These expectations don't change when they open a mobile web page, if anything their expectations are higher.</span></p> 
     <!--more--><strong>They expect-</strong> 
     <ul> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span> The page they are looking at to fit neatly onto the screen with which they are viewing it</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span> To scroll up and down rather than horizontally, because it's what they have always done. </span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>The images to scale to the screen they are using and not take up the entire view or exceed it. </span></p> </li> 
     </ul> <p dir="ltr"><span>Simply put, they expect a website to look just as nice, and work just as well, on a phone or tablet as it does on their computer. Forcing them to work around poorly designed pages and go against their expectations creates a poor user experience. Mobile users are most likely distracted and need the site to be simple.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Part of meeting those expectations and creating a good user experience is making sure the content on your page is sized correctly. Google expects that too and they can tell when a website doesn't measure up. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/fix-your-viewport-fit-the-screen.html"><span>Sites that don't fit a viewport can often occur inadvertently when using a meta viewport tag.</span></a><span> What is a viewport? The viewport is the part of a webpage the user can currently see. If an image, or other content, is displayed at a width wider than the viewport, it can cause the viewport to scroll horizontally. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>To avoid this major faux paus, there are a few things you can do.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Configure the Viewport </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/fix-your-viewport-fit-the-screen.html"><span>(get the basics on how to do this!)</span></a><span>:</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Without a properly configured viewport, a web page will convert to the desktop version and try to display on the much smaller mobile version. This will lead to much scrolling, zooming and squinting on the part of the user. And, most likely, cause them to leave the site. Configuring the viewport will guarantee that your page renders correctly on multiple devices of varying sizes. Though, make sure to avoid setting large absolute CSS widths for page elements. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Remember, viewport sizes will vary based on the device, </span><a href="http://viewportsizes.com/"><span>but here's a handy dandy chart to give you an idea of where to start</span></a><span>. </span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Start Small &amp; Insert Breakpoints</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Breakpoints are the points where content will respond to provide the best possible layout. Don't be tempted to insert breakpoints based on the specific device, operating system or brand you are designing for. Instead, design for your smallest viewport and work your way up. Where does your content start to breakdown? As you begin to scale up, the quality of the content will begin to waver. This is where you want to insert a breakpoint. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>When it comes to the images you choose, consider smaller images for smaller viewports or set images to scale based on the viewport. Don't simply choose large, fixed width elements. </span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Media Queries</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Media queries allow content to be tailored to a specific range of output devices, without needing to change the content. For example when printing a web page you might want to skip a fancy background image to save the viewer?s ink or when content is being read by a screen reader additional content can be added to help explain an image. Media Queries help you do this. &nbsp;They also limit the style sheets' scope using width, height, and color.</span></p> <h3><span>Also, remember:</span></h3> 
     <ul> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Don't hide content: Work on making it fit rather than simply removing it. </span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Make your text legible: Color, size, font, they are all important. Especially when using mobile sized screens. Make sure your users can read your content. </span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Watch out for third parties: If you are using another party's videos or widgets, you can't guarantee they are configured to fit the appropriate screens. </span></p> </li> 
     </ul> <p dir="ltr"><span>Don't let obnoxious scrolling and oversized images ruin your user's experience on your website. The content is what tells your customers that they should choose your company, it shouldn't overwhelm them. Use these techniques to make sure your content measures up. </span></p> <p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-36768326-bc23-9ff3-b38c-45b1178973a8"><br><br></strong></p> <p><strong>

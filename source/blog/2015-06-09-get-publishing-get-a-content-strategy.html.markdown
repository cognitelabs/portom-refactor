You, the one reading this, no matter your business, are a </span><span>publisher.</span></p> 
     <!--more--><p dir="ltr"><span>You might have some questions. You might be confused. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>"Who? Me?" You might ask. And to that I say, if you have a website, then yes, your organization is now a publisher. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>(And if you don't have a website, don't worry. We can rescue you from the 1990's and bring safely into the 21st Century.)</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>You might also ask, still in denial, "But, I'm a flooring company, what do I publish?" &nbsp;But that, my friend, is not the right question. The right question is, "What </span><span>should</span><span> you be publishing?" Because, even as a flooring company, or an insurance agency, or a software company...you </span><span>should</span><span> be writing. You should be publishing. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>It's a hard truth that nearly every business needs to realize. But, the web is a little like an ocean. Without good content, your website can get lost in the vast amount of web pages, information and data. But, don't worry, we won't let you drown. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The sooner you get on board the life raft we are tossing you, hop out of the river Da-Nile and accept that you should be publishing, the happier and more successful you will be. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Because not realizing it? That's risky. Not seeing that, as a publisher, you have a duty to your readers/customers, to provide information that they care about, can cost you. Because, they do care. They do have questions. I mean, have you ever met a customer that didn't ask questions? </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>If you don't willingly don your publisher's cap, it can cost leads and fewer leads means fewer customers. Fewer customers means sacrificing your bottom line and even if you still aren't sure you're a publisher (really, though?), you </span><span>are</span><span> a business owner. And, as a business owner you have a duty to your bottom-line.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>So, your next question might be, "Well, have </span><span>you</span><span> realized it?" </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>And to that I say...</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>We Saw the Light:</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>We took a breath, squared our shoulders, declared ourselves publishers and stepped out of the river and onto the muddy, murky shore; into the land of content marketing. And we quickly realized that to be effective content marketers, we needed a Content Strategy. So, we started writing. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>But, as we began writing, we quickly realized that there was a lot more to creating engaging content than we had been prepared for. We couldn't just write, we needed to inform. We couldn't just inform, we needed to engage. And to engage we needed to answer some important questions:</span></p> 
     <ul> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Who are our customers?</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>What do they care about?</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>How do they want to consume content?</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>When do they want to consume content? </span></p> </li> 
     </ul> <p dir="ltr"><span>That was a lot to figure out. We needed a way to focus our efforts, to learn what to create and to see what was working and what wasn't. </span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>What Is Content Strategy?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>According to John Lavine, Director of the Media Management Center at Northwestern University, content strategy is, "credible, trustworthy, transparent content that enhances the organization?s strategic goals." A good content strategy will work to do a number of things. It will:</span></p> 
     <ul> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Be mapped to the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/HubSpot/kukesh9-16-2014final" target="_blank">Buyer's Journey</a>&nbsp;</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Be relevant to your customers</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Deliver content when and where your customers want it</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Prompt engagement</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Prompt readers to take profitable action</span></p> </li> 
     </ul> <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>So, What Should We Write?</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Without a strategy that accomplishes these things, we could type until our fingers fell off and never connect with a single customer. Since the strategy centers around engaging readers who we hoped would turn into customers, we created </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/creating-personas-helps-you-focus-your-efforts.html"><span>personas</span></a><span>. To do this we used real data and analytics. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Now the question before us was, what kind of content would resonate with our audience? Also, where were they along the buyer's journey? Were they merely intrigued by our services or were they on the cusp of buying? </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>By answering these questions, we could begin to create relevant content for people that actually </span><span>cared</span><span> to read it. Whoa, crazy. While our content primarily consisted of blog posts, we also thought that we should offer tools that would make it easier for our personas to do their jobs. It was meatier, more engaging content. We were pretty proud of it. We patted ourselves on the back. Congratulated each other on producing top-notch content, and then got a swift kick that landed us right back into that dirty river, Da-Nile. While we had some engagement, for the most part, no one was reading our posts. Ouch...</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>So, we put on our water wings on, swam back to shore, and tried again. What did we need to do to repeat the process that got us the great content, but </span><span>then</span><span> scale it up? Get it out there. Get it seen. Because what's the point in writing great content if no one sees it? If a great article gets posted on Twitter but no one retweets it, did it ever exist? &nbsp;So, we needed to answer another question.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>What Were Our Content Goals, Anyways? </span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>What were our goals for our business and therefore, the job we wanted to assign to our content? When we first started writing, we had a severe case of the "gimmies". "Gimmie leads, gimmie traffic, gimmie engagement, gimmie conversions?" We were like an obnoxious child at a toy store. Until we got our hand smacked and learned we couldn't have everything we wanted. It's a tough lesson, but, we learned it. So, if we couldn't have it all (at least right away) we decided what we most needed were leads and insight into our conversion rates. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>To get this, we focused on the content... and then some. We needed to promote the content, but across the right channels. We needed more than just blog posts. We needed the right way to promote our materials. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>By digging into analytics, looking at the numbers and paying attention to specific interactions, we were able to see which efforts were having the most impact. For instance, </span><a href="http://startuplansing.org/"><span>with StartupLansing,</span></a><span> Facebook got much more interaction than Twitter. We also noticed that the more we posted, the less interaction we got. Too much of a good thing, right? So, we hypothesized that the better plan was to post more in-depth and informative content less often. </span></p> <p dir="ltr">Once we asked the right questions and focused on answering only those questions, we saw a difference. We got leads. We could actually see that we were doing something right. Things were going well. We were afloat and didn't want to slip back into the river.</p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>You Live, You Learn</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>To make sure we didn't mess up, slow our momentum or drop the habits we had picked up along the way, we needed to constantly remember what we had learned. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>We Learned:</span></p> 
     <ul> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>A Content Strategy is crafted to help a target audience be better informed </span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>A content strategy is crafted to drive "profitable customer action"</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Where, when and how each matter when it comes to content and your audience</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>A good content strategy likely encompases multiple forms of media. (This is something we are continually working on and exploring, ourselves. Stay tuned.) </span></p> </li> 
     </ul> <p dir="ltr"><span>But, we know what </span><span>we</span><span> learned. What did </span><span>you</span><span> learn? We laid down a lot of truth in this post, maybe we were a little harsh, maybe we told you some stuff you didn't want to hear. But, it was for your own good, trust us. We didn't just toss you into the river and hope that you would float, we were nice about it? Right? </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Well, if you still feel a little lost, here are some more breadcrumbs for you to follow on your path to publishing success. </span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>What You Should Do Next:</span></h2> 
     <ul> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Create a Persona (or two)</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Map those personas to the sales funnel</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Identify Your Goals (What do you want your content to do?)</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Add a Call to Action to all your content (see the bottom of this post for an example)</span></p> </li>

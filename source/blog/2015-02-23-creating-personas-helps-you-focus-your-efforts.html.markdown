To customers though, your business is one fish in a very large pond. They don't have to choose you - and won't - unless they have a reason to.</span></p> 
     <!--more--> <p dir="ltr"><span>Unless they care about you.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Unless they feel like you care about them.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>So, understand them. Get to know them. Learn about them.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Care about them? Understand them? These might not be phrases businesses are used to concerning themselves with. President of George Mason University, Angel Cabrera is often dismayed when she asks students what a business is and hears, "a function where money goes in and more money goes out."</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>He lets them know that "business is the beauty of bringing together people and things to make the community better...Empathy is the one tool that makes it all happen." More and more this idea that </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/its-not-just-business-its-personal.html"><span>business is not just business, put personal</span></a><span> is being put into practice. And to begin to connect with customers, businesses need to understand them.</span></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>Creating Personas Clarifies Understanding</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>Personas are fictional representations of your ideal customer. They are profiles of the customers you hope to connect with, filled with information that allows you to create meaningful interactions that customers will remember. And creating a memorable experience for a customer can mean not only their sales, but their loyalty.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>They can close the disconnect between data and the actual people standing before you. Your customers are more than numbers and that's how they want to be seen. Personas put a representation of that person in front of you; they force you to give them a voice. It can take a jumble of data on a computer screen and turn it into a person. </span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Personas are not?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Just data. Just like people, personas are not just data. They are not just a breakdown of the demographics of your customers, they are representations of the people that keep your business running, and people are more than data.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>So, why use them?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>When NASA decided to send an American into space, they didn't just point the rocket at the sky and hope he landed somewhere interesting; they aimed for the moon.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The same goes for your marketing campaigns. You will have much more success when your efforts are directed at something, or someone, concrete rather than just an uncertain void. If you don't aim, you'll likely waste time, money, and effort producing marketing collateral that won?t result in more leads or sales.</span></p> <p dir="ltr">Using focused personas, however, offers a <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29583/6-Core-Benefits-of-Well-Defined-Marketing-Personas.aspx" style="font-size: inherit;">number of benefits when it comes to marketing</a> including: better quality leads, an understanding of customers needs, better product development and more.</p> <p dir="ltr">For user experience design, they help you to build <a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/why-would-a-customer-use-your-app.html" style="font-size: inherit;">better apps that solve important problems for users.</a>&nbsp;When designing an app, you envision it relevant for&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;user, right? Is that user your grandmother? Your BFF? A business user? Each of those people will have different design needs and personas help you clarify those needs.</p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>How to Create a Persona</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>Personas will contain different components, based on whether they?re being used for marketing or design. Some common elements include:</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><strong>Background</strong>&nbsp;</span><span>- What are your persona's interests? What did they study in school? How did they get in the field they are in now? Why do they what they do now and it is it likely to change? </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Demographics</strong><span> - Age, income, location, education. All that kind of stuff. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Goals</strong><span> -What is your persona's number one priority on a daily basis? Over the next year? Five years? </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><strong>Quotes</strong> - </span><span>Actual things you - or members of your team - have heard them say, relevant to your product or business.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Where to get this information:</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>There are a number of ways you can gather information to begin to piece together your first persona. Sites like Hubspot and Google Analytics are ideal for seeing who is visiting your site and clicking your content. There are also things you may already know from personal experience and various interactions with your customers. You might know the content or product your customer is looking for based on previous knowledge or keyword analysis.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>This was the case for StartupLansing. In order to target our content, we created a persona named ?Startup Stan."</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>To gather information on Stan, we not only used Google Analytics, but also information we had learned from interviews with various stakeholders in the startup community, our own experiences, and, most importantly, conversations with other entrepreneurs in the area.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Once we had the information, we had to figure out what to do with it. We synthesized the information using a multitude of charts that combined everything we knew about Stan. From there, we discussed the importance of each piece of information to decide what should be included in the persona. To help us narrow our scope, we used the topics mentioned above and created bulleted lists with relevant information. The compiled information was then able to be turned into the completed persona.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><img src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/440551/file-2542076120-png/blog-files/startuplansing-stan-persona-page-2.png?t=1441046336424" alt="startuplansing-stan-persona-page-2"><img src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/440551/file-2533661867-png/blog-files/startuplansing-stan-persona-page-1.png?t=1441046336424" alt="startuplansing-stan-persona-page-1"></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><img src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/440551/file-2542076115-png/blog-files/startuplansing-stan-persona-page-3.png?t=1441046336424" alt="startuplansing-stan-persona-page-3"></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>But, what if you don't know?</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Not sure whether your persona is a more like a Time Lord from Gallifrey or a Hobbit from the Shire? That's ok. You don't need to wait for data. If you are a startup or business who isn't yet collecting data, you'll still have some ideas about who your customer is or will be. Create a few personas, use educated guesses, and then just pick one and go.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Once you start creating content&nbsp;and observing how people interact with your business, you might find that your user&nbsp;or customer isn't who you thought it would be.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>That?s to be expected.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>You might aim for a certain age group but find an older demographic actually really loves your product. And that's ok. Change it. Aim at something new. Personas are constantly changing and evolving, based on data.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Creating and choosing the most valuable personas may take time, but once you know who to aim your efforts towards, you will begin to get closer to your target and, eventually, hit your Bullseye.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Need Help Creating a Persona?</span></h2> <span id="docs-internal-guid-d7f24d5e-b731-df9f-224f-97f4780c482f">

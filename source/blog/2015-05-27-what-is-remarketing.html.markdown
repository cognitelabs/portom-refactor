     <!--more--> <p dir="ltr"><span>I?v</span>e spoken with many business owners who feel marketing is hard while 1 to 1 selling is much easier. Why? The reason they give is they tailor their message, the reference clients they use, and their value propositions to the person they are talking with. They customize their message, references, and value propositions based on industry, company size, problem, etc. This is very effective.</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>With marketing they wonder how can I possibly send an effective mass message to my audience that is effective?</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Fortunately with digital marketing it is getting easier and easier to tailor messages to individuals. We see this with email list segmentation, targeted adwords, cookie tracking, and remarketing.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Creepy?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Some people think all this tracking is ?creepy? and are turned off by it. To paraphrase Lincoln: You can?t please all of the people all of the time. Advanced tracking can actually be useful. If I want to go on vacation would I rather see ads of the beautiful Pictured Rocks in Michigan?s Upper Peninsula with a 20% discount package or would I rather see ads for WrestleMania? Clearly the Pictured Rocks.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><img src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/440551/pictured-rocks.jpg?t=1441046336424" width="624px;" height="416px;" alt="Photo Credit: Sharon Mollerus (Flickr https://www.flickr.com/photos/clairity/203781765)" title="Photo Credit: Sharon Mollerus (Flickr https://www.flickr.com/photos/clairity/203781765)"></span></p> <span><span><br></span></span> <p dir="ltr"><span>In fact, for me that is actually helpful. I?m a business owner and have a family. With lots of pressure on my time sometimes things slip off my to-do list. A reminder about a vacation package or an anniversary gift can help take something off my to-do list and make me look like a hero.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Enter Remarketing</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Have you ever searched for something for example a Mustang, visited the company's (Ford in this example) and then seen ads for Mustang?s on YouTube or elsewhere? The initial search traffic is <a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/what-is-inbound-marketing.html">inbound marketing</a>. The customized ads are remarketing ads. The goal is to bring users who visited a website back to the website to complete an action. Ideally remarketing campaigns are wrapping and delivering you customers.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/V90C73F5AVMtWXSll1xlcecqa5b9h28HBO25p7UAhG1BfCOCQEjyYi_6hJC3Aivbfibhr4qAVALnYZThstE5Ly97x9HNg_Gjk7DqsvP1oP6nskFWUNlIkxwJuL229WogFSFmPKY" width="624px;" height="416px;" alt="Gift Wrapped Customers from inbound marketing" title="Gift Wrapped Customers from inbound marketing"></span></p> <span><span><br></span></span> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Wow, I?d love Gift-Wrapped Customers</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>If you are the type of person who likes to dive right in, Google has </span><a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2454064?hl=en" target="_blank"><span>extensive documentation on creating remarketing lists</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>If you like to have help, companies like </span><a href="http://www.image3marketing.com/remarketing-detroit/" target="_blank"><span>Image3Marketing</span></a><span>, PerfectAudience, AdRoll, Retargeter, and Bizo can help you. Honestly there's a lot of complexity.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Things to Keep in Mind</span></h2> 
     <ol> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Different ad networks have different remarketing tools. Google?s network is different from Facebook?s, twitters, etc.</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>You can segment your remarketing list based on which pages visitors have been to (or not) on your website.</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>If you have an email list you can hyper target ads (Facebook, Google, etc.) to specific individuals.</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Remarketing Lists for Search Ads is a way to match ads with search terms. Going back to the Mustang example where a visitor has landed on my site after searching for that awesome car. Imagine they now search Google for Corvette. WIth Remarketing Lists for Search Ads Ford can show them an ad stating the #1 reason people buy Mustangs instead of Corvettes. Powerful stuff right?</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Images convert better than text ads and since you are generally bidding for placement this lowers your cost per click (known in the industry as CPC).</span></p> </li> 
     </ol> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>What About Mobile Remarketing?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>More and more users are using mobile (iPhones, Androids, iPads, etc.) to surf the web. However a lot of mobile surfing is done through mobile apps. Google and other companies have recognized this opportunity and created remarketing tools for mobile apps.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>For example someone who puts items into a mobile shopping cart, even if they don?t complete a purchase typically come back and make a purchase </span><a href="http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/201247/google-mobile-app-tracking-remarketing-tools-on-t.html" target="_blank"><span>within a week</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>To integrate remarketing into mobile apps app developers must integrate the tracking code in each app. Check with your IT department or contractor for how to use remarketing tracking codes when building your apps.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>More Resources</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>We aren?t experts at everything and remarketing is something relatively new for us.

It can streamline supply chains, help us hire the right people, prevent disease before it spreads, and <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/225917" target="_blank">predict Academy Award winners</a>. But, data is only a tool. And like all tools, it's only useful in the hands of an experienced craftsman. 
      <!--more--></p> <h2>Data is Just a Tool</h2> <p>Years ago, I tried to take up woodworking. I actually kind of enjoyed it, but I never really got the hang of using my bench plane. If you looked at my workbench, you'd see scarred wood where the plane cut into the wood. I was convinced the plane was defective. So, I took it to the woodworking shop where the guy behind the counter took a look, then started shaving off paper thin strips of wood from a piece of scrap.</p> <p>The problem wasn't the plane. It was me.</p> <p>I didn't have his experience, thus I didn't have his technique, his ability to read the grain, or know how to set the depth of the plane properly. A tool that was worthless in my hands, was valuable in his.</p> <p>Data is also just a tool. And the people in your business - your employees, managers, and executives - have spent years learning your industry, your customers, your suppliers, and your competitors. They've built up a lot of intuition and experience. They know, even if just loosely, where there are hazards to avoid or opportunities to embrace. In their hands, data can be really valuable.</p> <h2>Ask the Right Questions</h2> <p>The type and amount of data that you end up gathering varies considerably based on the questions you need answered or the problems you need solved. Want to figure out how to do better, personalized marketing? Then, maybe you want to capture social data, browser data, or search data and pair it with order history or shopping cart abandons. Maybe you want to use that data to create demographic profiles. If you're interested in gaining insight into your suppliers and vendors, then you'd likely mine different data. It all depends on the question you want answered and the <a href="http://wp.me/p3FeN8-aW">kind of big data problem</a> you have.</p> <p>This is where front-line managers and employees' experience is most valuable. Are there relationships, associations, or hunches that 'feel' like they might be worth exploring? Open questions they don't know how to answer? Models they don't know how to build? Such intuition is essential for getting started, even if the data ends up telling us that the intuition is wrong. A lot of time will have been saved by having a <em>direction</em> from the start.</p> <h2>Recognize Possibilities</h2> <p>While it's not necessary for every employee to become a data miner, data scientist, or developer, it is important that your employees understand the <em>possibility space</em> provided by the vast amounts of data currently available. Knowing what kind of data is available (text, voice, database, social, etc.) and how it can be manipulated, even if only conceptually, can unleash latent creativity and intuition.</p> <p>This may be difficult for some. It requires thinking of transactions and interactions in terms of information and data transfer. It means recognizing relationships across departmental or organizational boundaries. It means recognizing that data doesn't have to be in a spreadsheet, or even a database. This post is data! So are audio files, images, and movies. And it means learning to recognize how the information trapped in these different media could be reassembled to produce something insightful. But, we're confident many people will rise to the challenge.</p> <h2>Data has Been Around for a While</h2> <p>Data isn't new. We've been using it for a long time to inform our judgments and behaviors. It <em>informs decisions</em>, but <em>does not make them</em> for us. Big Data is no different. It's an evolution of a tool that vastly expands the possibility space, but it does not replace judgment, intuition, and experience. Data can inform, but it cannot create. It can highlight trends, but it cannot make decisions.</p> <p>That's up to the folks in your business.</p>

Furthermore, it allows you to capture the words your users use to describe their problems and experience, so that you can frame the product effectively.</p> 
     <!--more--><br> <h2>Interview Users And Stakeholders</h2> <p>One of the first choices you?ll have to make is deciding who to interview. Naturally, you will want to interview a diverse set of your ?typical? users. Or, if you don?t have users yet, folks who you think might be typical users or are typical users of a similar system. This will give you a good understanding of the general user experience.</p> <p>You should also consider interviewing extreme users; folks who use your product (or a similar one) way more than the average Joe. Talking to those folks may give you some ideas for habits they?ve formed or tricks they?ve picked up that reveal design insights that could delight your typical users.</p> <p>Another group of folks you may want to interview are non-users of your system, particularly if those non-users exist within the same context as your users. For example, if you?re at a Chamber of Commerce meeting and talking with small business owners about their accounting software and find someone who doesn?t use software, that might be interesting. Why doesn?t she use software? What does she do instead? Is she getting satisfactory results? </p> <p>Finally, you should aim to interview stakeholders and payers, especially if you are targeting a B2B market where the user and the customer are different people. For example, if you were designing a product that streamlines the tracking of receivables and invoices, it might be worth talking to the manager of a Collections department. She might not be the primary user of the system, but there are probably use-cases or metrics she cares about that could influence the rate at which the software is adopted. From a business perspective, she may also be able to provide information about who controls the purse and at what price/value points she or her peers can buy your product without needing another level of approval.</p> <h2>It?s all in the Question</h2> <p>While interviewing is a great tactic for getting feedback about your product, it can be difficult to craft good questions. All too often, the temptation is to ask leading questions that prompt the answers we want to hear in order to validate our ideas and avoid rejection. Remember, your baby might be ugly.</p> <p>Instead, focus on open-ended questions that are rooted in your observations and empirical evidence. The goal is to try and get to concrete information. Additionally, you want to avoid binary questions or questions whose answers would be represented on an absolute scale. Here are some examples of bad and good questions:</p> 
     <table class="highlight"> 
      <thead> 
       <tr> 
        <th>Bad Question</th> 
        <th>A Better Question</th> 
        <th>Justification</th> 
       </tr> 
      </thead> 
      <tbody> 
       <tr> 
        <td>Is x an important feature to you?</td> 
        <td>I noticed you never use x when you work. Why is that?</td> 
        <td>People often overstate how important something is to them. Observing their actual behavior and askign them about it will yield more insightful responses</td> 
       </tr> 
       <tr> 
        <td>How often do you do x?</td> 
        <td>How many times yesterday did you do x?</td> 
        <td>People aren't generally good estimators. By making the reference concrete, you'll get a more useful answer.</td> 
       </tr> 
       <tr> 
        <td>How much/big/little/etc is x?</td> 
        <td>How much/big/little/etc is x relative to y?</td> 
        <td>Absolute units usually don't tell us anything. By comparing x to something else, you'll get a clearer sense of what's important.</td> 
       </tr> 
      </tbody> 
     </table> <p>Asking good questions is challenging and takes time to learn to do well. Heck, we?re still constantly refining our own approach to asking questions. Just remember, the goal is to try and get as close as you can to first or foundational principles that motivate user behavior. The clearer you are about user intent and user motivations, the faster you can build them a successful tool.</p>

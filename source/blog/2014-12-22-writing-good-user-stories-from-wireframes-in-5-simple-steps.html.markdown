They are also an essential tool used in </span><span>software planning and estimation</span><span>. If you?re more of a marketer or a designer, or even a junior developer, who has never written a user story, it can be hard to know where to start. One easy way is to translate them directly from your wireframes or mockups. To do so, follow these simple steps:</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><em>(Note: this post was partially inspired by this post from Balsamiq on <a href="http://blogs.balsamiq.com/ux/2013/02/06/using-mockups-in-your-agile-user-stories/" target="_blank">using mockups in agile user stories</a>)</em></p> <h1><span>1. Create Your Wireframe</span></h1> 
     <!--more--><p dir="ltr"><span>Wireframes are </span><span>low-fidelity prototypes</span><span> of an application?s interface as you expect the user to experience it. Generated from <a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/user-interviews-and-user-experience-testing.html">user interviews</a>, <a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/user-experience-testing-with-observation.html">observations</a>, and your understanding of the user's problems, they are fundamentally communication tools that help to visualize how your application will solve your user's problem. Because they are communication tools, and user stories are about communication, t</span><span>hey are a wonderful basis for writing good user stories.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Using your favorite wireframing tool (we use Balsamiq and iMockups), mock up the core elements of the interface, as you expect your user to experience it. Remember, because wireframes are primarily about communication, this shouldn?t take a lot of time. The goal isn?t to make them pretty, but rather to develop a representation that reflects the path you intend your users to travel as they try to accomplish their goals.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/CzZjAFXHtp-9rfxYIr2_ndElUwykkW8aSA7nNEuYGrwDySCkZ-djE1HSXRT9uWak4UttLE30gc1Q8UAB7c4JEK0z8C-B5tXWpLwiQ62oDrZfOv85yE3xFITR9KVMDK_gVA" width="592px;" height="504px;" alt="wireframe-of-user-persona" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="wireframe-of-user-persona"></span></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>2. Gray Out Distinct areas where you expect there to be different functionality.</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>Once you have the core elements of the interface mocked up as you expect the user to experience it, identify core elements representing essential user behavior. Here, you might group items that you expect to behave similarly together.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>For example, in this early wireframe from our upcoming persona-generation tool, we grouped naming the persona and assigning her a role together. This is because we expect that these two elements will behave fairly similar to each other, but differently from other elements.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KAmkNJYVyGHFXl4vYmsHCoqhTfxPOkQ30we6_dCDfk4LmLpRb50yDm8Jjn6PQXkEm1vRHFp-ytr45yBjlaKp2JKDzez-6N2ZVz0t8TC12F5dzCL08ILXO80wBNbMInbeZA" width="720px;" height="616px;" alt="wireframe-of-user-persona-grayed-out" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="wireframe-of-user-persona-grayed-out"></span></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>3. Assign Story numbers to each grayed out area</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>Once the areas are grayed out and you have identified core interactivity, assign story numbers to each area. These numbers will serve as the basis for the user stories you?re going to write. If possible, this process should be undertaken alongside your development team (or a representative thereof). They might see different groupings than you do, based on their expertise. If working alongside a developer is not an option, take a stab at it on your own. When it?s time to transition the user stories to a development team, what you created will be valuable. If necessary, they will ask for further clarification.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/0LgNt74gN9Ue-lIMT4IOmN35PcqtRyoCVgQZZSXNFHbnQIwTRokNDhVqfDvB4dHHgB7jIFmdV1DYuXtVlMb4-j1_r0DEmOzQoluwVF5pCgna5_AO6Im7qmIJxRgbpEOjLw" width="720px;" height="617px;" alt="wireframe-of-user-persona-with-user-stories" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="wireframe-of-user-persona-with-user-stories"></span></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>4. Jot Expectations for Each Story</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>One, by one, write notes to each story that describe what you expect to happen when a user interacts with that aspect of the app. These notes might include:</span></p> 
     <ul> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Expectations for how the site will respond to different events</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Popup modules or windows where you expect additional interactivity</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Open questions that need to be discussed</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Tasks that you need to make sure you go back and complete or notes about elements that still need to be designed for this interaction to happen as you might expect.</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>State information. Many people envision applications only in the ?ideal? state - when the app is full of beautiful user data. But what about the user?s first experience? What about when there?s an error? Do you expect a popup modal? Highlighting? Jot your expectations on these notes.</span></p> </li> 
     </ul> <p dir="ltr"><span>Title each card with a user story, which describes the goal you intend the user to be able to accomplish with this interaction - and why that goal matters. For instance, in the wireframe below, which is for Story 1, you can see the story in bold, the appropriate acceptance tests, and a note about something we need to do to move this forward. It?s clear, complete, and scoped.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/eqamDby0G5xQ4VLnI5ei3nP2tE0at5VgUCr03We_vEz9cOeAf-KlsD4blX8cxYjp9YhPq5ICTFuKYApK_Zls-0q_hpo4y-uk4QnOT3add_RPLk2eT8aU5l_XRGu3mpyipQ" width="720px;" height="452px;" alt="annotated-user-stories-on-wireframes" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="annotated-user-stories-on-wireframes"></span></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>5. Stories Will Evolve</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>As you work, you may find yourself regrouping elements, reassigning stories, and changing out the grayed areas. That?s normal. In fact, you should embrace it. Trying to make these changes when there was already a lot of code written would have been much, much harder. Remember, design and development are iterative processes, so you should feel comfortable changing things up as you work. Especially early on. Equally important, you should be getting feedback from users, stakeholders, and your developers along the way, so that you can make sure everyone is communicating well, together.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Writing good user stories is an essential part of building great apps. Following these five simple steps and using your wireframes as a guide, will help to make the process much easier, so that you can get your app built better, faster.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Need Help Writing Good User Stories?</span></h2> <p><span>Our free template can help you:</span></p>

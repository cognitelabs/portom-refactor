     <!--more--> <p dir="ltr">These platforms have their own metrics hidden within their respective systems, requiring you to spending time trying to <em>find</em> data, before you can even <em>use</em> it.&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr">And the use of data is the important thing.</p> <p dir="ltr">Data is hard to understand contextually when it is scattered in different places. &nbsp;However, simple data visualization tools, like Geckoboard, can help you to understand information about your business or customers easily and quickly.</p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Why a Dashboard?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>A dashboard is a visual representation of data. Configured properly, they can display current metrics or key performance indicators for your company. &nbsp;For marketers, dashboards are extremely powerful when it comes to metrics, social engagement, and increasing your customer base, especially since so many marketing tools have APIs that allow information to be shared easily. &nbsp;This information can help you determine channels or efforts are gaining traction and which are not.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>With a tool like Geckoboard, data is organized and clearly laid out, so it is easy to digest and analyze. Additionally, their dashboards can be used in a single department, or across a whole company.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>What Can I Learn?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span><a href="http://startuplansing.org">StartupLansing</a>, a site we sponsor to help grow the startup community in Lansing, presents an interesting exercise in learning. &nbsp;In order to understand the impact of StartupLansing, we track (among other things) social engagement. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Before we created the dashboard </span><span>we believed that our Twitter followers </span><span>were going to drive more traffic than Facebook, so most of our efforts for interaction were being focused on Twitter. &nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>To validate our hypothesis, we added both platforms to Geckoboard and measured traffic from them. In just a few seconds</span>, we found that we were getting much more interaction from people on Facebook than Twitter. &nbsp;Our Facebook friends shared more content, interacted more, and generated more subscribers to our newsletter than Twitter did. &nbsp;We could access the information quickly and make decisions quickly. Now, we have a more focused social strategy based on the metrics from each platform. &nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>By organizing the data on our dashboard, we also began to understand our different segments. We learned who was viewing what. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>For example, with the goal of increasing our social following, we were able to learn that most of the people we reached through Facebook were females between the ages of 25 and 34. &nbsp;We also learned that because StartupLansing?s newsletter was getting posted to Facebook, there was no real incentive to subscribe to the newsletter. &nbsp;We were hamstringing our growth.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>We now know better how we should curate content based on segment and channel. &nbsp;What we post on Facebook should be different than Twitter, not because we read a blog post that said it should, but because the data demonstrates people are interacting with our content differently. &nbsp;&nbsp;We are now thinking of creative ways to engage with people </span><span>across all channels, so that we can continue to grow our mailing list, without cannibalizing traffic</span><span>. &nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>While we could have learned all of this by creating some Google Analytics reports and digging into different views of the data, we got much of the same benefit without as much effort. &nbsp;</span>By adding just a couple social metrics to our dashboard, we are making different decisions than we would have made by merely making assumptions. &nbsp;</p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>It's Easy to Get Started</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>We love Geckoboard because it is simple, user friendly, and interacts with 100+ services to get data. &nbsp;It can connect to Hubspot, social channels (such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter), &nbsp;email marketing platforms like MailChimp, time tracking software like Harvest, Google Analytics, and much more. &nbsp;You can even create your own widget with custom data and generate unique charts and graphs.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Whether you are using Geckoboard, you have the flexibility to create different dashboards, based on your audience. For instance, if you are creating a dashboard for your design team to display the amount of tasks getting completed, you are not going to want to include the number of tweets sent in a &nbsp;week. &nbsp;Instead, you would want to include things such as; projects outstanding, projects completed, and revenue made. For a development team, you might want to track server up time. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Geckoboard makes that easy.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Once the channels are active, they just need to be monitored. &nbsp;Your metrics will be changing, so at this point you will be watching for trends, which you?ll see updated dynamically.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Based on these results, you will be able to tailor your efforts in response to the metrics you are seeing. &nbsp;Using your dashboard, you can learn what is working well, and what is not working out at all. &nbsp;You will be able to see what areas of your company need help and which areas are doing better than expected. &nbsp;This simple tool can help you view the performance of your metrics quickly and clearly, thus facilitating better decisions and better performance.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Geckoboard is a great tool that can help you view the performance of your metrics quickly and clearly. The result? Better, faster decisions and better performance.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>What else? What tools have you used to help visualize performance and track progress?</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>We Build Custom Dashboards</span></h2> <p><span>Need something custom built for your application?

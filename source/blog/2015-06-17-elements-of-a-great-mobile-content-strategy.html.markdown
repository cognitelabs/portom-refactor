That being said, it?s no longer enough to simply shrink content down to fit the screens of smartphones and tablets. The mobile platform presents endless opportunity to creatively engage users. By simply downsizing content, the potential for messages to be undermined and customers to be lost is high </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/get-publishing-get-a-content-strategy.html"><span>(because content is still important!).</span></a></p> 
     <!--more--> <p dir="ltr"><span>However, there are quite a few strategies to adapt your content for mobile. &nbsp;Unlike PC?s, mobile allots a small space for a large amount of information. It?s essential to make the most of that small space. By including powerful headlines, good formatting principles, and mixed media, you can be sure your user will be engaged and stay on your site.</span></p> 
     <ul> 
      <li dir="ltr"><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Know your mobile audience.</strong><br></span>It?s important to know just how your mobile users access your content. By studying what devices they?re using, how much time they?re spending on your mobile site, what kind of content on your site (or other sites) they?re consuming, and what actions they?re taking on mobile, it?s easier to get a better understanding of how to tailor content to a mobile screen. For example, if most users are accessing your content via tablet, it may be better to optimize around tablets, while still keeping smartphones in mind.<br><br></li> 
      <li dir="ltr"><strong>Headlines, Headlines.</strong><br>Headlines are essentially the only judgment a user has to see if he or she wants to keep reading. Good headlines are critical anywhere, but especially in a mobile context. With limited screen space, it?s important to grab attention fast, and give the user a reason to keep reading. In order to create great headlines, choose phrases that show benefit, are to the point, and are powerful.<br><br></li> 
      <li dir="ltr"><strong>Mix up your media.</strong><br>Nobody likes to read large chunks of just text. Given all of the wonderful things the Internet has brought us, the ability to share media at the snap of the finger is surely at the top of that list. Incorporate other media into your content to break up the monotony of pure text. We are shifting to a more visual society, and adding media such as infographics and video can help aid in digestion of information. In keeping with the mobile trend, augmenting your content with six-second Vine-like videos (when appropriate) can keep the tone fresh, modern, and light.<br><br></li> 
      <li dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Re-think Formatting.</strong><br>Even though space is limited in mobile, formatting is not something that should be sacrificed. Elements of desktop design content are usually taken out, such as captions and visible tags, when switching to a mobile platform. Content needs to be formatted specifically for mobile, with special attention to elements such as:<br>a.&nbsp;Large font and bold colors: helps to direct the user to the main points faster<br>b.&nbsp;Accessible Links: making sure they are far enough apart where a user can tap them and go to the correct link. (especially important when those links direct to a Call To Action)<strong id="docs-internal-guid-e8af6e95-fd9e-8454-d851-e4687ed0328f"><span><br></span></strong>c.&nbsp;<span id="docs-internal-guid-e8af6e95-fd9e-e6c1-6053-08831894cadb"><span> </span><span>A clean layout: streamlines the reading process.<br><br></span></span></li> 
      <li dir="ltr"><strong>Be Concise.</strong><br>It?s been said that mobile users don?t really read a lot of what they are looking at, instead opting to scan articles for important pieces of information. The Nielsen Norman Group recommends formatting your text for easy scanning. This includes keeping everything to the point, while getting your message across via bulleted lists, keywords, meaningful subheadings, and most importantly, smaller word counts.</li> 
     </ul> <p dir="ltr"><span>When creating mobile content, it?s important to not overlook the significance of these elements. They all have their place in creating a great mobile content strategy. By downsizing content to simply fit a mobile screen, you?re missing out on the opportunity to appeal to mobile users--a community that now consists of nearly 2 billion people.</span></p></span>

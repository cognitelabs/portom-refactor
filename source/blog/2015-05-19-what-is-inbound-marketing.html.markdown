Do you have a stack of business cards on your desk that you collected but haven't followed up on? Possibly worse, are you paying sales people to staff booths, attend networking events, etc?</p> <p>We've been there. We've handed out cards and information at these events and know follow up rates are attrocious, even for hot leads.</p> 
     <!--more--> <p>Contrast that with how great it feels when the phone rings and you hear the voice of a prospect who wants your help. How great does it feel when you take the call and the customer is asking you to help them? Thats why you got in the business right? To help people, not to spend time trying to explain to people what you do and why they need your service.</p> <p>What are your close rates, deal sizes, and time to close on those sweet incoming phone calls vs. the outbound efforts you make?</p> <p>We bet they're higher with the incoming calls and referrals.</p> <p>Inbound marketing gets more people to contact you. Better yet, these customers are educated on</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li><span style="font-size: 13px;">your value propositions</span></li> 
      <li>the services you provide</li> 
      <li>your pricing model</li> 
     </ul> <h2><strong>Billboards are Inbound Right?</strong></h2> <p>While TV advertisements, paper mail, radio ads, sales flyers, telemarketing, etc. get customers to call this is not typically how we think of inbound. The reason is because those are paid placements. And while they may play a legitimate role in your marketing mix, it's a different channel than one in which a customer comes looking for you.</p> <p>With these channels, the customer isn't seeking out the solution; the solution is being shoved in their face.</p> <p>Inbound differs by providing value first. Typically this value is information provided in blogs, podcasts, video, eBooks, enewsletters, whitepapers, or social media content.</p> <p>It's searchable, relevant, and targeted towards the problems that your prospective customers are wrestling with&nbsp;<em>at this very moment</em>. They're looking for you and a good inbound strategy assures they'll find you.</p> <h2><strong>Wow that sounds great? Why isn't everyone doing this?</strong></h2> <p>Inbound marketing is the new kid on the block. The term was coined by Brian Hogan in 2005. 10 years later, not everyone has heard of inbound, but most people have heard of viral marketing (you know those videos that get millions of views).</p> <p>So how would I dive in and get a jump on my competitors?</p> <p>There are four steps I'll discuss: Attraction, Engagement, Conversion, and Delight. After explaining the four steps I'll provide specific actions you can take right now to get started.</p> <h3><strong>Attraction</strong></h3> <p>Before someone can buy your awesomeness they need to find you. That is what attraction is about, developing content that people will be interested in reading. However all traffic is not equal. For a mid-Michigan coffeeshop like Biggby, getting 1 million visitors from Japan reading a blog post about Sumo wrestling is not going to generate a good return on investment. It would be better for Biggby to get 100 customers searching for 'what factors should I consider when buying a franchise.'</p> <p>The best way to ensure articles target potential customers is to capture an ideal customer in a buyer persona. Personas are ficticious ideals of people who love what you sell. Buyer personas capture your customer's demographics, motivations, goals, challenges, common objections, etc. If you haven't heard of them read <a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/creating-personas-in-5-simple-steps.html">how to create user personas in 5 steps</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Engagement</strong></h2> <p>After you've attracted visitors to your site the next step is to engage with them. You just made their life better with a sweet blog post right? What else can you help them with? Think about what more you can offer them based on the page they landed on. Offers are things like eBooks, whitepapers, tip sheets, emplate, etc.</p> <p>These offers are more valuable content you are giving them. However this time you collect their email address in exchange for the tool you give them.</p> <p>Why are you collecting their email address? This visitor has shown they liked your blog post and they want more help with their issue. By collecting their email address you can provide additional help.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Convert</strong></h2> <p>This is what you've been waiting for. You've helped educate the visitor on or even helped them solve a problem. You've provided them an offer (whitepaper, etc.) to further help them. They've been picking up what you've been putting down. Now it's time to see if they want more substantial help from an expert (you!).</p> <p>At this point, they know what you do. They know you are good at it (otherwise they wouldn't be wasting time with you) they have some trust in you (otherwise you wouldn't have their email address). You know something about the problem they are trying to solve. These are good signals there might be a match.</p> <h2><strong>Delight</strong></h2> <p>I bet you thought Inbound Marketing ended with putting the customer into the sales process right? Nope! The cool thing about inbound and the reason it is so effective is because you are giving to people expecting nothing in return. You are putting your knowledge and expertise out into the world to help people.</p> <p>You will have fans who love you. I promise (you have a mother right?) You know who thse fans are. Let them help spread your message. Let them refer their friends to your content and offers.</p> <h2>Geting Started with Inbound</h2> <p>Now that you know the why, here are concrete actions you can take for each of the four steps.</p> <h3><strong>Attraction Tactics</strong></h3> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Blogging - gone are the days when customers stumbled across your ad in the yellow pages or the newspaper. Today, attention spans are measured in seconds. People have text messages, emails, snapchats, tweets, etc. bombarding them throughout the day. More often than not they don't have time to focus on reading a newspaper uninterrupted.<br><br>Your blog is your chance to help. People search google&nbsp;<strong>over 3.5 billion times per day</strong>. When they are searching, they want something. If you can match their intent, you will hold their attention, you will earn their gratitude.<br><br></li> 
      <li>Search Engine Optimization - OK you've made a killer blog post. Do your favor and help your customers find you. Tools like&nbsp;<a href="https://adwords.google.com/ko/KeywordPlanner/" target="_blank">Google Keyword Planner</a>&nbsp;show users&nbsp;the terms customers are searching for. For example if you post about annuties the the Keyword planner will show you if potential customers are search using phrases like "<em>annuities"</em>&nbsp;or "<em>building your own retirement plan</em>."<br><br></li> 
      <li>Social Publishing - You have a Twitter and Facebook account right? Use them! If you take the time to write up a killer post on how to help your dogs live healthier lives the more people who read it the better the world is.&nbsp;<br><br>Two more tips:&nbsp;<br><br><strong>First:</strong> ensure you include a photo or graphic&nbsp;because posts with photos get a whopping&nbsp;<a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2015/03/02/11-tactics-to-get-more-click-throughs-from-social-media/" target="_blank">84% higher click through rate</a>&nbsp;than posts without images. Don't have the perfect image? Use&nbsp;<a href="http://pixabay.com/" target="_blank">public domain images from pixabay</a>. Public domain means you can modify them any way you want and don't need to include attribution.<br><br><strong>Second:</strong> Find out where your buyers hang out online. What forums are they on? Develop a presence there. Answer some questions and be helpful. Then post links to your blog posts when a natural point in the conversation arises. Done correctly this will drive 1,000%+ more traffic than your Facebook and Twitter posts for slightly more effort.</li> 
     </ul> <h3><strong>Engagement - Tactics</strong></h3> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Forms - to collect their email address you'll need to have a form on the page for them to give it to you. Pro tip, the more information you ask for the more likely visitors are to give up. To get the highest sign ups just collect an email address. You can get additional information like their name and budget later.<br><br></li> 
      <li>Calls-To-Action - These are buttons or links that entice visitors to click to download your content. Pro-tip use split testing tools like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.optimizely.com/" target="_blank">Optimizely</a>&nbsp;to maximize your conversion rate. What is split testing? This lets you test a different message with a portion of your website traffic to determine which message works better with your audience.<br><br></li> 
      <li>Landing Pages - Landing pages have one job, get the website visitor to perform an action - either buying from you or giving you their email address for an offer.</li> 
     </ul> <h3><strong>Conversion - Tactics</strong></h3> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Sales engagement - At this point you can turn this lead over to your sales team and they can continue the engagement process. Oh you don't have a sales team? In this case you can follow up via email (see the next step).<br><br></li> 
      <li>Email - You can continue providing valuable content via email sprinkled with calls to landing pages with sales offers on them.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aweber.com/" target="_blank">AWeber</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank">MailChimp</a>&nbsp;can automate the processs for you.<br><br></li> 
      <li>Marketing Automation - This goes a step farther than the email campaigns AWeber and MailChimp provide. Marketing automation tracks a particular lead and the sales lifecycle they are in. Sophisticated workflows can be put together to maximize the effectiveness of the messages they are getting.</li>

     <ul> 
      <li>Surveys - Ask your superfans what you can do to improve your service. Be thankful for both the positive and negative tips. The customer isn't always right but all feedback is good feedback.<br><br></li> 
      <li>Special Offers - Do you have extra tickets to a Lugnuts game? Give them to one of your super fans. People love to share stories like that.<br><br></li> 
      <li>Social Recognition - Recognize your fans on social media. Put photos of them in your posts.</li> 
     </ul> <p><strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">What about Inbound for Mobile?</strong></p> <p><span>Smartphones and tables represent special challenges. How do you attract, engage, convert and delight mobile users? That is a big can of worms and I'll be blogging about that later. The key things to know in the meantime are that mobile visitors often times have a different intent than a desktop visitor and it is harder to do data entry on a mobile device.</span></p> <h3><span>Mobile Intent</span></h3> <p><span>Are your mobile visitors looking up your company on the way to a meeting with you? Do they want to call you but can't find your phone number? Are they showing a friend at a wedding their favorite new company? Or maybe they are browsing the web while watching Game of Thrones. The point is they are probably busy with other tasks.</span></p> <h3><span>Mobile Data Entry</span></h3> <p><span>If you are like me you type about 100 times faster on a computer than your phone. You've tried text to speech and failed. You've tried swype and failed. Begrudgingly you have decided to just type as little as possible on the phone. This creates a problem for marketers. How do you balance data collection with convenience?</span></p> <p><span>I've given you a preview of the special challenges mobile devices create. Check back next week and you'll have a full post on it waiting for you. I promise.</span></p> <p><strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">Thats all folks!</strong></p> <p>We covered what inbound marketing is, what inbound marketing is not, and gave you an overview of the typical components of an inbound marketing strategy.</p></span>

Who would you expect to work on the project? I?d wager, a few different people come to mind: architects to design the house, builders to handle construction, electricians to wire the house, plumbers to plumb it...you get the idea.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Constructing software isn?t much different.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>
       <!--more--></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>It requires different people with different skillsets working on different parts of the project at different times. Instead of electricians, there might be database experts. Instead of plumbers, server-side developers. You get the idea.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Our job, as software engineers, is to help you architect and design the right system that solves the right problem for your users. Our app development process accomplishes this in a few phases:</span></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>Phase 0: Needs Assessment...Do You Need Us?</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>Not everyone needs a custom built home. Sometimes, you just need someone to point out which neighborhoods have homes like the one you want. Other times, you might do some soul searching and realize that maybe you don?t need a new home at all - you aren?t really prepared for the hassle and headache that comes with it. Sometimes the bank denies financing.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Before we sit down to talk about engineering software, we take time to listen, to ask questions, and to prod. We want to understand </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/got-99-problems-but-i-only-get-one.html"><span>what problem it is you?re trying to solve</span></a><span>. In some cases, we might find an off the shelf solution that solves your problem. The solution might require a little tweaking, but that?s about it. So, we point it out and maybe help with a small install. That?s usually much faster - and less costly - than a full engagement. Everyone goes home happy. &nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Other times, we?ll listen and realize that maybe </span><a href="http://startuplansing.org/three-characteristics-perfect-startup-customer/"><span>you don?t really know who your customer is</span></a><span> or how your business model will pan out. Maybe you haven?t done enough </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/user-interviews-and-user-experience-testing.html"><span>user interviews</span></a><span> or observations. In these cases, we might offer some resources to help you to go and get clarity on the problem before investing too much time and money in a solution nobody wants.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>In either case, prior to entering any engagement, we always start with the assumption that our clients may not need us and that more value might be available elsewhere. It?s not because we don?t want to do the work, it?s simply that we want to make sure we?re doing right by people. There are a lot of smart people working on a lot of problems all around the world; sometimes our prospective clients just need to be pointed in the right direction. We?re happy to point.</span></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>Phase 1: Design, Architect, and Prototype</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>For nearly every new project, the first phase our app development process is a design and prototyping phase. During this phase of work, we work to understand requirements and users, often creating wireframes, then translating them into </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/writing-user-stories-to-build-great-apps.html"><span>user stories</span></a><span> and storing them in the product backlog. We use this phase to provide better estimates for level of effort because providing estimates around general, vague ideas will doom a project.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>In some cases, we use this phase to prototype features or architectural requirements we aren't sure how to accomplish or estimate. We don't know everything. And this phase allows us to do low fidelity tests that uncover opportunities or gaps we may not have been able to anticipate.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>At the end of this phase, key deliverables often include design documents or diagrams such as annotated wireframes or process diagrams. Additionally, there is often a document outlining the next phase of work.</span></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>Phase 2: Software Estimation</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>Once we?ve spent time architecting the software application, we compile what we?ve learned into user stories - user-based story cards that identify why the requirements matter for users. Often, </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/writing-good-user-stories-from-wireframes-in-5-simple-steps.html"><span>these are derived from the wireframes we?ve put together</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><a href="http://www.cognitelabs.com/writing-user-stories-template-download">Click here to download our FREE User Story Template, designed to help you think about apps from the perspective of it?s most important people...its users.</a></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>With the user stories loaded into Asana, we create the product backlog and share it with both the development and project stakeholders (e.g., clients). Then, the development team will go through a round of estimation, trying to understand how difficult each task is, relative to other tasks in the backlog. This often becomes the basis of a subsequent statement of work, which is usually for a fixed set of features.</span></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>Phase 3: Prioritization and Sprint Planning</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>Once the backlog is compiled and the difficulty of the tasks is estimated, we work with clients </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/how-we-prioritize-user-stories-in-asana.html"><span>to rank and prioritize user stories</span></a><span>. In some cases, one part of the application might be dependent on another part being built. In those cases, some measure of prioritization is determined for us.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>In many cases, though, clients have to make choices. Given their time frame, scope, budget, and the level of complexity we?ve estimated for any number of tasks, we?ll decide which features are ?essential? and which are ?nice to have.?</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Once we?ve prioritized the backlog, we organize the backlog into sprints - two week chunks of work in which we promise to deliver some number of features, based on the prioritized backlog. The purpose of the sprint is both to make sure that we?re constantly delivering software. Sprints also allow us to stay focused (new features can?t be added to a sprint, once it?s started), but be flexible (every two weeks, we?re re-evaluating priorities). </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/six-ways-to-sink-software-sprints.html"><span>Poor sprint planning can sink a project</span></a><span>.</span></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>Phase 4: Testing and Staging</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>At this point in the process, we?re developing software. In most cases, we use a combination of different kinds of automated tests to make sure that the code is working properly. At a high level, the tests will correspond with the user stories we?ve created since, at the end of the day, user experience is often what matters most.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>But there will also be some manual testing: does the flow make sense? Are there any unforeseen bugs? To facilitate this, we will often stage the completed work in an environment accessible only to the development team and project stakeholders. At this point, everyone gets to test the system to make sure it?s working properly. Bugs and questions are recorded in Asana.</span></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>Phase 5: Production and Maintenance</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>Once the system appears to be functioning properly, we deploy the software to the web, making it ?live.? At this point, users can use the system and the new features we?ve just implemented.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Because no application survives first contact with the user, we will discover (uncover!) sub-optimal design choices and weird bugs. Those get recorded in the product backlog or the bug list and get scheduled for maintenance in subsequent sprints.</span></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>Rinse, Wash, Repeat</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>Unless the project is for something static, like a dashboard, nearly all applications will require some kind of maintenance. At this point, from following our app development process, we will be in a good rhythm of sprint planning, software development, testing, and deploying. As the engagement continues, we continue to work on improving velocity and performance, so that the application remains healthy.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Like building a house, designing, developing, and devloping an application is a complex undertaking. Using a disciplined process helps to improve the odds that your project is a success. As you consider developers for your project, make sure you ask how they will help you to manage each of these phases.</span></p> <h2><span id="docs-internal-guid-4e1120f9-fcc1-0d98-dbad-bebef726131c"><span>Want to Learn More About What Happens in our Dev Shop?</span></span></h2> <p><span><span>

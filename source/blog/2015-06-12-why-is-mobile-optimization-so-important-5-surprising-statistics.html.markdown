I doubt I?d be shocking anyone if I said mobile is everywhere. Given that <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/05/12/dominos-pizza-tweet-a-pizza-twitter-tweet-to-order-fast-food-restaurants/27175005/">we?re now able to order a pizza with just a tweet</a>, there?s no question that the advent of mobile devices has changed the way companies do business forever. What remains under the&nbsp;radar are the hard facts behind the need for companies to adapt their websites to mobile. The numbers talk, and what they?re saying is that if a website isn?t optimized for mobile, there?s a good chance the business is losing out, not only in sales, but in reach!&nbsp;

      <li dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.75em;"><strong>A non-mobile friendly site can lose roughly 40% of search traffic.<br></strong>According to a collaborative study done by iAcquire and SurveyMonkey, the truth is that around 40% of people conducting a search on a mobile device will choose a different search result if they click on one that isn?t optimized for mobile.</span></li> 
      <li dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.75em;"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-72fa946e-e952-5854-5e91-5f43175acecc">Only 25% of mobile users will wait longer than 5 seconds for a search result to load.&nbsp;<br></strong>Mobile optimization isn?t all about design. When it comes to expectations for load time, <a href="http://e-commercefacts.com/research/2011/07/what-usrs-want-from-mobil/19986_WhatMobileUsersWant_Wp.pdf" target="_blank">most people believe that 3 seconds or less is ideal</a>. Mobile users are finicky when it comes to waiting, clearly, since only 25% of them will wait longer than 5 seconds. The other 75%? They will go in search of faster results.</span></li> 
      <li dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.75em;"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-72fa946e-e953-8c8d-72b9-fa7948d58d87">Mobile searches carry a 70% conversion rate within one hour.<br></strong>Users typically opt for mobile with the intent to take an action. <a href="http://www.iacquire.com/blog/mobile-behavior-big-game-seating-a-study-with-surveymonkey">70% of those users will complete that action within one hour</a> of starting their search. For example, of those searching for local businesses, half who searched via smartphone (and a third who used tablets) will visit the store that day.</span></li> 
      <li dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.75em;"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-72fa946e-e955-3881-957f-eae4cf6f1814">Of the mobile users who took action, half of the actions ended with a sale. <br></strong>Assuming increased sales are important to a business (they are), this statistic is especially telling. Essentially, if a website isn?t optimized for search both in design and speed, a large volume of search traffic is lost. Given that said search traffic carries a high conversion rate, and of that conversion rate, <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-50-percent-of-smartphone-users-exposed-to-ads-took-action-74760">half of the interactions result in sales</a>, this is pretty important.</span></li> 
      <li dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.75em;"><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Mobile campaigns increase ad awareness by about 20%.<br></strong></span><span style="font-size: 18px;">Dynamic Logic recently <a href="http://www.millwardbrown.com/docs/default-source/insight-documents/articles-and-reports/Better-Brand-Engagement-with-Display-Formats-Feb-2012.pdf?sfvrsn=4">published a study</a> illustrating that when it comes to online campaigns, mobile is the way to go. When compared to other online media such as flash, images, and rich media, mobile friendly websites significantly outperformed all other media on a few key metrics, including brand awareness, ad awareness, and purchase intent. Exposure to just one mobile ad campaign increased ad awareness by nearly 20 percent, and brand favorability and purchase intent by 4 and 4.9 percent, respectively.</span></span></li> 
     </ol> <p><span style="line-height: 1.75em;"><span style="font-size: 18px;">It's clear that mobile optimization is key in maximizing the search engine horizon of a business, and ensuring that potential customers take some form of action. Without a mobile-optimized site, it's statistically more likely that a company is suffering from some form of missed opportunity--whether it be lost sales, lost customers, or a lack of overall reach.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

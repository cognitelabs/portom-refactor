You didn't lose your Google ranking when </span><a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2015/04/rolling-out-mobile-friendly-update.html"><span>Google updated it?s algorithm</span></a><span> and you survived </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/what-is-the-google-mobile-friendly-update-aka-mobilegeddon.html"><span>Mobilegeddon</span></a><span>. You're feeling pretty good. </span></p> 
     <!--more--> <p dir="ltr"><span>But, take a closer look at your mobile site. Simply having one may make you feel like you've won. But that was just one battle, there's still a war on. </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/creating-user-experience-in-a-post-mobilegeddon-world.html"><span>There's more to mobile than just having a mobile site</span></a><span>. And, if you're making these critical mobile optimization mistakes on your mobile site, you're losing the war, and customers. </span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Mistake#1: Having Slow Anything</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>According to a <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/?wide=1" target="_blank">Kissmetrics study</a>, t</span><span>he majority of users are only willing to wait about 6-10 seconds for a website to load, many even less.&nbsp;</span><span>The same study says that a 1 second delay in page response can result in a 7% reduction in conversions. When it comes to your mobile site, nothing should be slow. Content, images, videos - they all contain the information your customer is looking for, and they don't want to wait for it. </span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Mistake #2: Needing a "Fancy" Site Design</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>You don't need an exact replica of your desktop site for mobile devices. In fact, you probably don't want it to be a replica- your mobile experience should reflect the needs of your mobile users (who have different needs than your desktop users). Trying to recreate it will simply make things cluttered and lead to the above-mentioned faux-paus. Your mobile site should be simple, easy to read, and able to load quickly. If the information is there, your users won't miss flashing banners and fancy slideshows. </span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Mistake #3: Having Obnoxious Media</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Sure, that video of the dancing cat or sassy kid may be funny, but if it doesn't load or play properly, your users aren't going to stick around to see what all the fuss is about. Many types of media, like Flash, simply aren't supported on mobile sites and will only reveal an empty box or annoying error message when played. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>On the flip side, media that plays automatically may be just as obnoxious as media that doesn't play at all. If your users are mobile, it probably means they are in a public place. If your company's catchy jingle starts playing on their phone in the middle of a store, cafe, or restaurant, they may close the site simply to avoid causing a disturbance.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><a href="https://cognitelabs.leadpages.net/leadbox/1414db373f72a2%3A17d7e942bb46dc/5676201666412544/" target="_blank">Are you guilty of some of these mistakes?

The dreaded 404. Some sites that work on a desktop, simply won't work on a mobile site. </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/contact.html"><span>(If you're not sure why, it's ok. We can help with that.)</span></a><span> If you don't take the proper steps to ensure compatibility, users may not even be able to get to your website via a mobile phone. And no visits means no conversions. &nbsp;</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Mistake #5: Recycled Content</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/elements-of-a-great-mobile-content-strategy.html"><span>Transferring content from your website to your mobile site isn't going to hack it in the mobile world.</span></a><span> Content on a mobile device needs to be focused, concise and straight to the point. Headlines should tell you exactly what information will follow and users should be able to get the answers they need with minimal scrolling. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Another content related boo-boo is to have </span><span>NO SEO (search engine optimization)</span><span> setup for your mobile site. Google doesn't ease up on its SEO guidelines for mobile sites. Know your keywords and use them in the spots that will get you the most traffic. </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/contact.html"><span>Not sure how to handle SEO? We can help with that, too. </span></a></p> <p dir="ltr">Do your site and your users a favor and avoid these mistakes on your mobile site. You'll not only save your customers major headaches, but you may attract more visitors and get more leads.</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>So, what are you waiting for? Make sure you're winning the war by finding out how your site can be the best mobile site it can be.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Need Help Optimizing Your Site for Mobile Users?</span></h2> <p><span>Are you guilty of making some of these mistakes?

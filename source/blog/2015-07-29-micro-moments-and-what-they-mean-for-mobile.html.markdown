     <!--more--><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>"Intent-driven moments of decision-making and preference-shaping that occur throughout the entire consumer journey."</strong></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>These moments occur when someone automatically turns to a device to complete a task, answer a question, get directions, etc. These are the moments that ultimately (ideally) lead to actions or purchases. These are the moments your business needs to be taking advantage of. </span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>The Shift:</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Marketers, advertisers and sales reps once looked to the Buyer's Journey as a map that would lead potential customers from leads to sales. Each stage of the journey (Awareness, Consideration, Decision) required specific tactics and techniques for helping a customer move on to the next step. No matter the stage, the customer needed to be nurtured, their needs met and their questions answered before they could move on to the next step.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>While the buyer's journey is still a legitimate marketing tool, consumer practices are changing. Customers, often, are no longer going through all the stages of the journey before they buy. Instead, they are turning to a solution they have in their pockets at all times; their smartphones. The ability to find a solution at the tips of their fingers is allowing the customer to go straight from Awareness to Decision.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/how-micromoments-are-changing-rules.html"><span>91% of people look up information on their smartphones</span></a><span> while in the middle of a task. Before they have completed that task, they may be ready to purchase. </span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>The Moment: </span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Consider a painter who, in the middle of a painting, realizes he won't have enough of a certain color to complete his project. By simply picking up his phone, searching for the brand and color of the paint he wants, he can find nearby locations that sell it or, even better, get it shipped within a few days. He's not going to spend time considering (stage two of the journey) different brands or styles or even locations. If he finds what he needs, he's going to purchase it. Right then. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>This is a Micro moment. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/micromoments/"><span>62% of smartphones users are more likely to take action right away toward solving an unexpected problem or new task because they have a smartphone. </span></a></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The things that are going to affect whether or not this particular customer takes that step (order the paint) have more to do with the ease in which he can find the product, maneuver the site it's on, and purchase the product, all while still holding a brush in the opposite hand. </span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>What Does Micro Mean for Mobile?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>You may be wondering, "How can I market in a moment?" But maybe this isn't what you need to be focusing on. Instead ask, "How can I answer questions/solve problems in a moment?" </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The best way to do this is to make sure your website is ready and responsive when your customer jumps on to see if your product is right for them. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>To do this, your mobile website should:</span></p> <h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Be responsive-</strong></h3> <p dir="ltr"><span>Do all your links work? Do they lead users seamlessly from one task to the next? If you website doesn't respond to each touch and tap, you're at risk for losing customers. </span></p> <h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Load quickly-</strong></h3> <p dir="ltr"><span>They are called micro moments for a reason. It only takes a moment for a user to decide whether they will purchase from your site or move on. </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/mobile-page-speed-milliseconds-matter.html"><span>And actually a moment is as little one second. </span></a><span>In one second they start to lose focus, in three seconds, they consider moving on. In five, they're gone. </span></p> <h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Have Awesome Calls to Action (CTA)-</strong></h3> <p dir="ltr"><span>CTAs are important. They give your user the instruction they need to take the next step toward purchasing. </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/mobile-ctas-get-users-to-pay-attention.html"><span>Mobile CTAs have their own rules.</span></a><span> Make sure you follow them and make sure your customer has a clear action to take. </span></p> <h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Use All the Right Stuff-</strong></h3> <p dir="ltr"><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/why-certain-plugins-arent-right-for-mobile.html"><span>Plugins</span></a><span>, </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/fix-your-viewport-fit-the-screen.html"><span>viewports</span></a><span>, </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/how-improperly-sized-tap-targets-could-be-sabotaging-your-mobile-website.html"><span>tap targets</span></a><span>...oh my! These are all necessary pieces and they all need to be configured specifically for a mobile site (Not sure what these are? That's ok, </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/contact.html"><span>we can help)</span></a><span>. If any of these are set incorrectly, your mobile website will be hard to read, hard to operate and hard to navigate. Your user will become frustrated and the micro moment will pass on by. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The customer journey is shifting. It's less of a journey and more of a sprint. Recognizing and planning for the moment your customer is ready to make a decision (and giving them the ability to make it quickly) is key keeping up with the shift. Plan for moments, and make sure your website is prepared. &nbsp;</span></p> <strong id="docs-internal-guid-bf33c09a-da5e-e255-1d4f-24e21ead2c8a"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></strong></span>

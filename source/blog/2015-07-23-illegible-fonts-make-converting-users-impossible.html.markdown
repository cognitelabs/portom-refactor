One of these things is choosing font sizes that don?t give your user the ability to read content, or picking super obnoxious fonts for that same content. </span></p> 
     <!--more--> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>What Does That Say?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>We?ve all been on a mobile website where the choice of font was too small. However annoying it is to pinch and zoom to read content, that issue is potentially a quick fix (that is, if the user is feeling up to pinching and zooming). On the other hand, trying to read typography styles that are too compact, are in cursive, or are visually overwhelming, isn?t so easy to fix. In both cases, users can end up feeling bothered by the content, and may decide to give up on the site.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>So, what constitutes true font legibility? The concept is a pretty subjective one, open to interpretation. What one person finds illegible may be legible to others who can see better, and vice versa? In any case, it?s best to stick with fonts and sizes that are accessible to users across the board. If it seems like it could be hard to read, it probably is.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Google Says:</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Luckily, Google does have some recommendations when it comes to sizing font using media queries, to clear up any debate. Before I get into the specifics, it?s definitely worth noting that </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/fix-your-viewport-fit-the-screen.html"><span>a great deal of how fonts are sized and viewed on a mobile webpage has to do with the configuration of the mobile viewport</span></a><span>. It?s best to start there, and manipulate fonts after ensuring they will be scaled appropriately on mobile devices. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Google recommends sizing fonts using pixels as a unit of measure. There are three other units, points, EMs, and percents, but these units are all relative measures, whereas pixels are absolute. The best approach, according to Google, is to find a base size for the font (</span><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/UseLegibleFontSizes"><span>they recommend size 16</span></a><span>), and size additional fonts (headings, subheadings) according to the base size. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>So, with font sized correctly, you?re 100% good to go? Not quite. There are a few other things to keep in mind when it comes to font that, when done wrong, can negatively impact visibility.</span></p> <h3 dir="ltr"><span>Contrast</span></h3> <p dir="ltr"><span>With respect to contrast, make sure that the font is not the same color as the background. Or even close in color. Refrain from putting ?charcoal? colored font on a gray background. These two colors are too similar and don?t provide enough contrast for the font to be legible. </span></p> <h3 dir="ltr"><span>Too Many Fonts</span></h3> <p dir="ltr"><span>Too many different fonts on the same page can be overwhelming. When in doubt, less is more, and </span><a href="http://www.noupe.com/essentials/icons-fonts/mixing-multiple-fonts.html"><span>three to five font selections is generally a good rule of thumb</span></a><span>.</span></p> <h3 dir="ltr"><span>Horizontal and Vertical Spacing</span></h3> <p dir="ltr"><span>Fonts that don?t have adequate spacing &nbsp;give the user a cluttered view, and even when sized correctly, can still be difficult to read. Choose fonts that have a good amount of horizontal spacing, as well as vertical height. Alternatively, it?s also possible to manipulate the media query to configure spacing attributes such as line height, and character spacing, by hand. </span></p> <strong><strong><br></strong></strong> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Ask Yourself...</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>When choosing fonts, the most important thing to ask yourself &nbsp;is, ?Can any user read this?? If the answer is no, fix it. If the answer is no, ask some more questions: &nbsp;</span></p> 
     <ol> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Is the content sized appropriately? </span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Does the content follow basic typography etiquette? &nbsp;</span></p> </li> 
     </ol> <p dir="ltr"><span>If the user can?t read the content, it?s ridiculous to think that they will be able to do anything productive on the website, let alone convert into paying customers! </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>All of these are fairly easy to change&nbsp;but can become somewhat technical pretty fast. This article only skims the surface of font selection-a topic that has a great deal of depth.

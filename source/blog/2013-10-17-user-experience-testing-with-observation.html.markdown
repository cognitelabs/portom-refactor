But, determining the right problem to solve can be easier said than done. So, we recommend <a href="http://cognitelabs.com/got-99-problems-but-i-only-get-one/">generating hypothesis</a> about several different problems you think are worth solving, then testing those hypotheses to determine which problem is worth solving. </p> 
     <!--more--><br> <h2>Two Approaches</h2> <p>While there are a lot of ways to validate the problem you?re working on, including pre-selling the product to customers before it?s built, we tend to favor observation and <a href="http://cognitelabs.com/user-interviews-and-user-experience-testing/"> user interviews </a> when it becomes time to build the app. Both of these approaches allow us to understand the total user experience - their context for the application, the job they need to accomplish, and the things they may value in an application. In so doing, we can build a better product.</p> <p>To be clear, in this context, the user experience you're testing isn't necessarily their experience with your product, but rather their experience in the real world. Understanding this context is a necessary prerequisite to building a good product. </p> <h2>First, Open Your Eyes</h2> <p>The famous design firm IDEO is known for making awesome products. They designed the first mouse, the first laptop, and a slue of other cool things. And the source of much of their design inspiration? Observation. In <a href="http://cognitelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/0385499841">The Art of Innovation</a>, Tom Kelley emphasizes paying attention to how people interact with the products around them. He describes how observing areas where people struggle, asking ?dumb? questions that both empathize with users and give them the benefit of the doubt, and gathering many, different types of perspectives and interactions helps the firm to clarify problem statements and design great products.</p> <p><a href="http://cognitelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mouse-for-apple" target="_blank"><img alt="IDEO's first mouse" src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/440551/file-1740137907-jpg/blog-files/applemouse_hero_626px.jpg?t=1441046336424" style="text-align:center;"></a></p> <p>The same process should be applied to software applications.</p> <p>If you read our post on <a href="http://cognitelabs.com/got-99-problems-but-i-only-get-one/">generating hypotheses</a>, you should have generated several problems you think worth solving for a particular user or group of users. These problem statement hypotheses describe your assumptions about a user and their experience of a problem in the world that you intend to solve. Now, go out and see if you can find people trying to solve one of those problems. What tools do they use? How are they interacting with those tools? Where are they struggling? Do they know if they?re struggling? <strong>Do they even care?</strong></p> <p>Taking time to observe real people - i.e., your users - attempting to solve a problem does a few things. First, it allows you to validate the problem exists. For instance, if you?ve defined a potential problem as ?helping small business owners with little accounting knowledge track receivables,? but can?t find a small business owner struggling to track their receivables, you might be focused on the wrong problem.</p> <p>Observation also allows you to pit one problem statement against the other. If it?s not clear your potential user is struggling to track receivables, maybe it is clear they?re struggling to manage expenses. By having a few problem statements at the ready, you might not see the initial problem you expected to, but you may see one of the other problems you?ve articulated. The problem you see occur most frequently is likely the one worth solving.</p> <p>Finally, observation allows you to empathize with your users. When you take the time to see the world from their perspective, it becomes easier for you to design a product they?ll love to use. Observation allows you to account for the subtle quirks and annoyances that frustrate users and take up their valuable time. Watching them solve the problem will help you to avoid these pitfalls.</p> <h2>User Experience Testing is Ongoing</h2> <p>Observation is also great if you already have a working product. Chances are you?re monitoring web metrics, which tells you what users are doing, but little about the overall user experience. Analytics cannot answer the question <i>why</i>. User experience testing through observation can help you answer these questions - both why they're using the product and how they feel about it. By selecting some of your users to observe, you will learn a lot about their subjective experience, which can help you refine the product, prioritize features, and make sure you?re delivering the the best possible value.</p> <p>Regardless of the stage of development, understanding the user experience and testing the user experience against your initial hypotheses aobut their experience allows you to bridge the gap between your perception of the world and the perception of the world belonging to your users. In so doing, you can be confident that you're solving a meaningful problem that will delight your users and keep them coming back to your product.</p>

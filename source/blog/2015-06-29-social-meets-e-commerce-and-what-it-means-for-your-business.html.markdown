Twitter's doing it. And now, Pinterest is doing it. Over the last few years they've transitioned from sites where you interact with </span><span>people</span><span>, to sites that allow you to interact with products. They </span><span>were</span><span> social. Now, they are social/e-commerce. </span></p> 
     <!--more--> <p dir="ltr"><span>SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Robert Peck predicted that 2015 would be a potentially ?breakout year? for e-commerce on social media platforms. And, with the recent introduction of the Pinterest "Buy" Button, it seems he was right. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>This newest addition to the social/e-commerce world will give users the chance to click a button and buy the items they were once merely admiring on Pinterest. Without even leaving the app, they can click and purchase their favorite items. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>We already told you that </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/the-mobile-ecommerce-experience.html"><span>by 2016, worldwide B2C e-commerce sales will total around 1.9 trillion dollars.</span></a><span> But, look even farther ahead. As a collection of total retail sales, e-commerce sales will reach </span><span>$2.5 trillion in revenue by 2018</span><span>, according to eMarketer. Buying stuff on the web is clearly a roll that just won't slow. And, if you're a product business, you should definitely roll right along with it. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>And today, being on board with e-commerce clearly means being on board with not only </span><span>mobile</span><span> e-commerce, but also </span><span>social</span><span> e-commerce. </span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>What can you learn from the "Buy" Button?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>The first, most important thing about the launch of the "Buy" button? It's launching on </span><span>mobile</span><span> first. Really, though, why wouldn't it? </span><a href="http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-strategy/pinterest-ecommerce/"><span>More than 75% of Pinterest traffic comes from the mobile app.</span></a><span> AND, Shopify merchants have seen orders from Pinterest on mobile devices increase by 140% in the last two years. We've said it before, and we'll say it again, Mobile is HUGE. We know it, and clearly Pinterest knows it and is taking full advantage of it. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The next lesson? Not only is mobile huge, but again, so is e-commerce. Sites that were once primarily social are recognizing this, taking advantage, and having little social/e-commerce babies. Twitter has introduced "Product Pages"- pages that list product information, reviews, and tweets about the product and the ability to buy it right from Twitter. Facebook has been toying with a similar feature. Instagram is even offering Call to Action buttons that allow users to buy or simply learn more. &nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Pinterest itself is primed to be the ultimate platform for buying since users are already treating it as a virtual shopping list- a wish list of all their must-haves. The items are already there, they know they love them, they know they want them, the only thing missing was the ability to buy them. What does this mean for merchants? It's another, proven popular, platform for merchants to reach and connect with an </span><span>already engaged</span><span>, massive audience. </span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>What This Means For You:</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Simply put, the merging of social and e-commerce means, if you sell a product, you need to be ready. Maybe you've never bothered with social media. Maybe you've never had to. But, looking at the facts and the direction these sites are taking, chances are...you'll want to. &nbsp;According to a Shopify study, </span><a href="http://www.shopify.ca/infographics/pinterest"><span>an average price of purchase made through Pinterest is $50</span></a><span> which is higher than any other major social platform. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>While we may be getting a little ahead of the game, right now Pinterest is only partnering with select retailers like Macy's and a few others, now is the time to start preparing. The button may not take off as quickly as some are predicting, but it's definitely indicating a trend in e-commerce, one that you should get on board with if you are a product company. </span></p> <strong>How can you prepare?</strong> <p dir="ltr"><span>So, what can you do now to prepare for the ongoing merger of e-commerce and social media?</span></p> 
     <ul> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Get Your Stuff on Pinterest Now</strong><span>- not just to sell it, but simply to get eyes on it</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Take Advantage of "Promoted Pins"</strong><span>- This will get more eyes on your product and get a new audience viewing it</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Learn The Site</strong><span><strong>-</strong> Get to know it, take it to dinner, wine and dine it. Learn it's secrets.</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Treat it Like a Virtual Mall</strong><span>- Use it to advertise. Use it as a storefront. Let users window shop until they are ready to buy. </span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span><strong>Make Sure Your Mobile Site is Optimized</strong> - Users are using Pinterest on their phones. If they click through to your site, what will they find? </span></p> </li> 
     </ul> <p dir="ltr"><span>To sum up? Get your stuff on Pinterest. Advertise on Instagram. Interact on Facebook. These sites aren't just extra ways to distract yourself during work anymore. They are valid ways to advertise, reach a targeted market and sell your stuff.</span></p> <h3 dir="ltr"><span>Why Does All This Matter? Find Out.</span></h3> <p dir="ltr"><span>

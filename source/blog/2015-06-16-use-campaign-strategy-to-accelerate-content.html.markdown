She'd discovered yoga after her first child was born as a great way to stay in shape and relax and now, pregnant with her second child, she wants to continue her yoga routine. So, she takes to the internet with her queries; "Can I do yoga while pregnant? What are the best poses? Are certain poses best during certain months??"</span></p> 
     <!--more--><p dir="ltr"><span>Meanwhile, on the other end of the internet, Just Bend, an established yoga studio, is looking for new ways to bring in more customers. Through previous research, they already</span><span> know the importance of a content strategy</span><span> - that without good content on their site they could easily be lost in the ocean of web pages, information and data that is the internet. So, they set out to create content. But, while accepting the responsibility of creating great content is half the battle...sadly, it is only half. Well, less than half. Well...it's only part of the battle?. </span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Campaign Strategy is NOT Content Strategy </span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Content Strategy is a holistic endeavor; it looks at how to use content to grow a business or organization as a&nbsp;whole. A Campaign Strategy is what gives the content direction. There can be multiple campaigns in any one content strategy but they will all contain multiple parts and, in order to know which direction to take them, you have to know where to aim them.&nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><img src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/440551/hubfs/Campaign_Strategy_.png?t=1441046336424&amp;width=510" alt="campaign strategy mapped to sales funnel" width="510" style="width: 510px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="campaign strategy mapped to sales funnel"></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>While </span><span>Just Bend</span><span> is a fictional studio and River a fictional character, this very real interaction happens thousands of times a day across the country. Customers are searching for answers, companies are ready to answer those questions. Like River, they may have questions about pregnancy yoga, or the studio may get inquiries from football players, senior citizens and more. &nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Once businesses like Just Bend start using keyword research to dig further into their inquiries, they may notice the Rivers of the world are scouring the internet looking for yoga poses to do while pregnant. River may be fictional, but the </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/creating-personas-helps-you-focus-your-efforts.html"><span>persona she represents a real person</span></a><span>. &nbsp;For companies looking to develop a campaign strategy, their personas are where they want to start. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/creating-personas-in-5-simple-steps.html"><span>Personas are representations of your ideal customers.</span></a><span> The people you want to reach out to and bring into your business. The people who have questions you know you can answer. Knowing that customers like River are looking for specifics about doing yoga while pregnant, Just Bend can begin to structure a campaign that will not only answer their questions, but also lead those customers through </span><a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33711/The-Steps-You-Need-to-Define-the-Stages-of-Your-Sales-Marketing-Funnel.aspx"><span>the sales funnel.</span></a><span> </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><img src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/440551/hubfs/sales_funnel.png?t=1441046336424&amp;width=364" alt="three types of sales funnel" width="364" style="width: 364px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="three types of sales funnel"></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>So, what does a campaign strategy, particularly one geared toward a River the Yoga Mom persona need to be successful? </span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Elements of a Campaign-</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Your personas are the first step in building a campaign, the next is building the campaign </span><span>around</span><span> those personas. The elements of a campaign will usually not vary, but where you invest the most effort, the amount you use which element and when, will. Use your persona, where they are in the funnel and the needs they've expressed to figure out what exactly your campaign looks like. </span></p> <h3 dir="ltr"><span>Keywords</span></h3> <p dir="ltr"><span>Each campaign should have it's own set of keywords; breadcrumbs that will lead customers to your business and into your funnel. These keywords should have the versatility to be used through different kinds of posts, videos, landing pages and more. For a campaign geared toward River, you could focus on keywords such as; best pregnancy yoga, benefits of pregnancy yoga or best pregnancy yoga poses. These phrases could easily be used in a number of blogs, in descriptions of instructional videos or in checklists. </span></p> <h3 dir="ltr"><span>Blog Posts</span></h3> <p dir="ltr"><span>While you want to deliver quality posts through every phase of the funnel, the things you are writing about will vary based on where your target persona is within the sales funnel. This post is geared toward those at the top of our funnel; customers that may not be familiar with concepts like campaigns or terms like keywords. A yoga studio looking to bring pregnant moms into their business may start with a simple, informative post about the benefits of doing yoga throughout their pregnancy. These posts should be focused and target the keywords they?ve identified as important for their persona.</span></p> <h3 dir="ltr"><span>Offers</span></h3> <p dir="ltr"><span>Offers are premium content that you share with your personas in exchange for something valuable, like lead information. The offer may be small (a list of the top five yoga poses to do while pregnant), but the information you can gain from the offer is important in order to lead the persona through the funnel and to gain new leads.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>You Live, You Learn</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>When it comes to organizing content around campaigns, we learned our lesson the hard way, which is why we want to make it easier for others. When we first started producing content on a consistent basis, we did not follow the above advice. We didn't target content towards specific personas and we didn't structure campaigns. We were writing willy-nilly (yes, I said willy-nilly) without any clear direction or focus. This created a number of problems.</span></p> 
     <ul> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>We didn't get leads because the content wasn't relevant to anyone</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>It made it harder to come up with ideas</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>We didn't know which ideas were working (and which were not)</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>We didn't know who we were talking to</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>It was harder to produce content consistently </span></p> </li> 
     </ul> <p dir="ltr"><span>When we finally wised up, got organized, created clearer personas and geared campaigns towards those personas, we started gaining leads and we also had a much clearer picture of what was working. </span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Tag, You're It</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Now, it's your turn. We made the mistakes, now you can reap the benefits of what we learned. Go ahead, look at your funnel. Create a few personas. Consider the questions they might ask at different stages of the funnel. You know the answers, so answer them. Then, consider how those answers be turned into content for each stage the of the journey. How can those posts be turned into offers? And how can those offers turn your leads into customers?</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Need Help with Your Campaign Strategy?</span></h2> <p><span>Need help launching a campaign strategy designed to increase the number of leads your business gets?

And one of the hardest parts is aligning your vision for what the product can and should be with the requirements a development team needs in order to produce a product. The gap between product development - or the idea in your head - can be quite large. Writing user stories narrows that gap, facilitates communication, and provides measurable milestones that you - and your development team - can use to estimate, organize, and execute work. </span></p> 
     <!--more--> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>What is a User Story</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>User stories are short, 1-3 sentence cards that describe three things:</span></p> 
     <ul> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>A subject (who the actor is in the story)</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>A goal (what the subject intends to accomplish)</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>A purpose (why that goal is important)</span></p> </li> 
     </ul> <p dir="ltr"><span>When organized this way, user stories help you and your development team to better empathize with your user, so that you can build them software they?ll love because it?ll do a kickass job of </span><span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/got-99-problems-but-i-only-get-one.html">solving their problems</a>. </span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>How to Write a User Story</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>User stories are best written after you?ve done some </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/user-interviews-and-user-experience-testing.html"><span>customer development interviews</span></a><span> and created a good persona. Ideally, user stories inform wireframing and prototyping, as well as software development. User stories are an iterative process. It is through these interviews, observations, and tests, that you home in on the real goals, struggles, and opportunities available to your target user.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Once that?s completed, writing user stories is easy, <a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/writing-good-user-stories-from-wireframes-in-5-simple-steps.html">especially if you already have wireframes</a>. &nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Then, to construct the story, you just use the formula above. For example, one of the applications we?re currently developing is a simple tool for creating persona templates. For this application, our target users are professional marketers and user experience designers. Our persona?s names are Marketing Mindy and UX Henry.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>So, an example of a story we might write for Marketing Mindy is:</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Marketing Mindy (who) wants to name a persona (the goal), so that she can better empathize with him/her as a person (the why).</span><span> </span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Build on the Foundation</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>While many user stories only include the story - and, for a small app, that might be fine - it?s also common to include: </span></p> 
     <ul> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Business value - how important, on a relative scale, this feature is. If it?s really important, it might be prioritized above other features. If it?s less important, and we?re running up against time or budget constraints, it might be axed.</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Technical estimates - Estimating software can be hard. A generally accepted practice is to use a relative scale to do story point estimation, which allows a development team to gauge how relatively difficult individual stories are.</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Acceptance Tests - How do we know if the user story is satisfied? Acceptance tests provide a list of criteria that must be met for the story to be assessed as ?complete.? For instance, in the example user story above, we might have as an acceptance test, ?The form is a required field and the persona cannot be saved without it?s name being assigned.? In addition, acceptance tests may have information about state</span><span>.</span></p> </li> 
     </ul> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Who Writes User Stories?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>In some ways, user stories are written by your users. If you?ve done a good job observing them and interviewing them, you?ll identify their goals, their reasons, and the tool you?re building will be intended to overcome whatever obstacles they experience while in pursuit of those goals.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Concretely, though, they are written by a combination of the client or project manager, a designer, and a developer (or representatives thereof). Each person will have a different perspective on the story, which will color how it is written, what values are assigned to it, and what the acceptance tests should be.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>As product development commences, stories, estimates, priorities, and acceptance tests will be reshuffled and re-evaluated. At some level, they?re never fully completed; software evolves as users interact with it. Eventually, though, the combination of rapid development, collaborative involvement, and keeping an ear to the ground will result in software that solves problems and delights users.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>Need help writing user stories?

In many cases, the traditional databases and file stores you currently use should suffice. However, there are three signs you might need to be looking at Big Data solutions: 
      <!--more--></p> <h2>Volume</h2> <p>If you have <em>a ton</em> of data, you might have a Bid Data problem. Big Data is probably most commonly associated with the problem of volume. If you need to process large amounts of data, say from a clickstream, then your problem might be large enough to consider using Big Data tools. Exactly <em>how much</em> data is needed to be 'large' is relative, but if you find your current system struggling to handle the load, it might be time to look at Big Data tools.</p> <h2>Velocity</h2> <p>If it takes <em>too darn long</em> for your data to process, you might have a Big Data problem. Latency refers to the amount of time that elapses between when a system receives an input and generates an output. If the latency of processing relative to the time you need to be able to use it is too large, then you might consider investigating some Big Data tools.</p> <h2>Variety</h2> <p>If you get data from a lot of different sources, then you might have a Big Data problem. For most companies, this is probably going to be their entry into Big Data architecture. As we accumulate more data from more places, getting a unified picture of a customer, a supply chain, an organization, etc., becomes increasingly difficult. For instance, your databases probably house all of your order information. But, what if you wanted to associate a customer's order history to their email and phone records or perhaps even their Twitter stream, to have a composite view of the customer when a Sales Rep answers their next call? Or, what if you wanted to evaluate your marketing campaigns across different channels? Then, you might need to look at some Big Data tools.</p> <h2>"Big Data" is a Relative Term</h2> <p>The term "Big Data" is frequently used, but there is no <em>one</em> criteria to distinguish a Big Data problem from a non-Big Data problem. Professor Michael Franklin at Berkley probably summed it up best:</p> 
     <blockquote> 
      <p><em>"Big Data is any data that is expensive to manage or hard to extract value from."</em></p> 
      <p>Michael Franklin Thomas M. Siebel Professor of Computer Science<br> Director of the Algorithms, Machines and People Lab<br> University of Berkeley</p>

This is where the importance of correct sizing of tap targets comes into play.</p> 
     <!--more--> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Tap Targets</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Tap targets are the places on mobile web pages where a user clicks the screen in order to accomplish a task. For example, if a user wants to open a link, they will click a tap target to open that link. Tap targets need to be sized appropriately to accommodate the diameter of the average adult finger pad; just under half an inch. In failing to size tap targets correctly, the user is set up for a <a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/creating-user-experience-in-a-post-mobilegeddon-world.html" target="_blank">frustrating and overcomplicated mobile experience.</a> &nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Consider a user trying to submit a form for payment information they?ve just filled out via mobile. <a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/the-mobile-ecommerce-experience.html" target="_blank">If the ?submit payment? tap target is too small to click, the user will not be able to submit their information</a> and complete the transaction without resorting to zooming in to click the target. This scenario creates additional work for the user. In the time the user needs to go through the additional steps required to complete their task, they may decide that completing the task isn?t worth the effort and abandon the transaction.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Size Does Matter</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>What is an appropriate size for a tap target to ensure situations like this will not happen? The sizing truly depends&nbsp;but experts agree- bigger is better. This is especially true when sizing important targets, such as frequently used links and buttons. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Important targets need to be: </span></p> 
     <ul> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>legible</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>discernable as an actionable element</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>accessible</span></p> </li> 
     </ul> <strong><strong><br></strong></strong> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Make It Count</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>According to Google Developers, on a properly configured mobile viewport, an important and frequently tapped target should be no less than 7 mm tall or wide. Although different platforms vary in their guidelines for tap target sizing, MIT has found that the average adult finger pad is between 16 and 22 millimeters wide, and a tap target sized at 7 millimeters or higher will likely accommodate that.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>When it comes to infrequently used tap targets there is no reason to size them at 7 millimeters. However, it is important to keep in mind legibility, making sure fonts are easy to read and work on mobile devices. Additionally, although size is not as important in the case of infrequently used targets, it is critical to consider spacing and make sure links are spaced at least 5 millimeters or more apart.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Don't give your users a frustrating mobile experience, make sure your Tap Targets measure up. Make them easy to find, easy to read, and easy to click. </span></p></span>

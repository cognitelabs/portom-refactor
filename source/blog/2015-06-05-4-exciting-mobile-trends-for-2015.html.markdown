How do I know that? I looked. Most trend articles are </span><a href="https://www.google.com/#q=top+mobile+trends+2015" target="_blank"><span>boring</span></a><span>. I want to take it up a notch and talk about what is exciting.</span></p> 
     <!--more--> <p dir="ltr"><span>First I want to talk about the trend that isn?t, Internet of Things. Do you know anyone whose fridge, toaster, or light bulbs are connected to the internet? Neither do I. IoT has been talked about since the 90s. It is not here this year in a major way it will not be. Even Apple?s Watch isn?t connected to the internet without a smartphone.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Wait, what about my TV, my car, etc? Yes in select niches devices are connecting to the Internet, but to say it is a trend is going much too far. Don?t believe me? Count the number of appliances in your house that are Internet connected. For most Americans that number is going to be 1 (your TV, OK 5 :) ) unless they cheat and count tablets. One year from now when everyone counts again the number will be the same. That means IoT is not a trend, it is still a dream.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>What are the Trends?</span></h2> <p><span>The big 2015 mobile trends are wearables, user interface, health, and payments. This year all these areas will make big improvements and if your company is riding the wave you will benefit.</span></p> <h3 dir="ltr"><span>Wearables</span></h3> <p dir="ltr"><span>Many people are saying ?A computer on your wrist, no biggie.? No biggie?! This is the Dick Tracy dream right? Only in a world of smartphones does a computer on a watch fail to impress. Why is that? This is early days. Do you remember the iPhone 1? It was slow, clunky, and hardly did anything.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>It is hard to believe but the first iPhone had:</span></p> 
     <ul> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>No App Store</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>One bad camera (2 megapixels)</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>A tiny screen (3.5 inches)</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Slow Internet (</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Low resolution (320x480)</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Slow processor (412 Mhz)</span></p> </li> 
     </ul> <p dir="ltr"><span>Today?s iPhone is completely different it is fast, sleek, and there is always ?an app for that?.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Wearables are going to be the same way. Google Glass was a nice try but didn?t take off. Apple took wearables to mainstream shipping 1 million units </span><a href="http://nypost.com/2015/04/13/apple-sold-1m-watches-on-first-day-firm/" target="_blank"><span>the day the Watch went on sale</span></a><span>. It took the iPhone 74 days to reach that milestone.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>2015 is the year the wearable trend starts exploding. Apple will release new versions of the Watch like clockwork (see what I did there? :) ). In 2 years over 100 million people will have Apple Watches. There will also be glasses (remember Google Glass?), fitness trackers, clothing, and things we can?t think of right now.</span></p> <h3 dir="ltr"><span>Participate or Not?</span></h3> <p dir="ltr"><span>If you have extra cash and want to differentiate yourself hop on the trend now. Starbucks did </span><a href="https://news.starbucks.com/news/starbucks-details-five-year-plan-to-accelerate-profitable-growth" target="_blank"><span>$4 billion in mobile sales last year</span></a><span> (25% of their revenue). They say it is ?game-changing for our customers and business base,?</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Starbucks hopped on mobile payments early and are now reaping the benefits. Increased user retention, increased average spending, and an improved user experience.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>If you have extra money and want to differentiate yourself from your competition this is a simple way to get in front of a trend that is going to be a tidal wave. If you are struggling to pay the bills today then sit out wearables and invest 3 years from now when it is mainstream.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>User Interface</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Do you speak to your device on a regular basis? Maybe a better question is does your kid who can?t even type or read? No idea what I?m talking about? Prepare to have your mind blown.</span></p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5n8Z5BmSSx8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p dir="ltr"><span>Apple isn?t the only game in town. Google Now and Amazon Echo, and most automakers have voice recognition technology. Keyboards and mice are going to go away as predicted in Minority Report, being replaced with voice commands, gestures, and eventually thoughts. In 2015 voice UI is the new trend.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Voice Interface provides these advantages:</span></p> 
     <ul> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Multitasking - your hands can be doing one task and your voice executing another.</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Faster input rate - you can give complex commands almost instantaneously instead of navigating through numerous screens or hunting for a button. (for example ask ?What is the weather in Sacramento California ? instead of pulling up an app or website and typing in the city and state.</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Faster input rate - it is also faster to dictate to a device than to type on a device.</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>New audiences - people who can?t type or read because they are young, old, have handicaps, or have disabilities can use voice interactions to overcome their typing and reading issues.</span></p> </li> 
     </ul> <h3 dir="ltr"><span>How can you use voice today?</span></h3> <p dir="ltr"><span>If you have a mobile app ask your team how you can integrate voice to make the app more convenient for users. If you don?t have a mobile app think about your website. Would capturing voice really help your mobile users (instead of a form)? Would voice navigation really help your mobile users? If so consider creating a mobile app with those features.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Health</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>With mobile devices always near someone and now with wearables even on someone devices are collecting more and more health data about their owners. A lot of my friends who have Fitbits noticed they started walking more just because when they tracked it they realized how much they weren?t walking.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>That trend is going to continue as devices track temperature, pulse, voice. There are even apps that look at eye color to determine health status and apps that diagnose troubled sleep patterns.</span></p> <h3 dir="ltr"><span>Health + You?</span></h3> <p dir="ltr"><span>How can you get in front of this trend? Well if you are in the healthcare field, think about how to take advantage of the data and sensors to provide health care solutions. If you aren?t in healthcare, use the apps to help your family and employees live healthier lives.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>For example instead of taking time off of work a year ago to go have my sleep diagnosed I used an the iPhone app </span><a href="http://mashable.com/2012/07/11/zeo-sleep-101/"><span>Sleep101</span></a><span> to figure out and then fix what was going on. Within three days of downloading the app I was waking up refreshed.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Payments</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Digital payments are frustrating. It is annoying to put in credit card payment on site after site in the exact format they need it. Credit card payments at stores are less annoying, but still slightly annoying. Mobile is a different story though. Mobile payments with the tap to pay functionality make payments frictionless (thats a good thing right?).</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Who is hopping on this trend?</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Apple, Google, Starbucks, Disney, and even fitness company Jawbone are hopping on mobile payments. Heck. Square is a mobile payments company.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Mobile payments make life better for consumers by removing friction and inconvenience (reaching into a wallet for plastic is tough right?!). However the big winners are companies. More data, better customer retention and higher spends. Disney?s </span><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/03/disney-magicband/"><span>MagicBand</span></a><span> even puts your credit card onto your child?s wrist.</span></p> <h3 dir="ltr"><span>Help Customers Pay You</span></h3> <p dir="ltr"><span>Few things are more frustrating than hassles around paying a company. Have you used Uber? You feel awesome. You hop in and hop out. No questions about which credit cards do you take, no thinking about the tip. Payments are invisible. Help your customers and your bottom line will thank you for it later.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>One Last thing</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>In case you missed it mobile websites are <a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/what-is-the-google-mobile-friendly-update-aka-mobilegeddon.html">no longer a trend</a> or a nice to have. Mobile traffic is now on par with desktop traffic and Google penalizes sites in their mobile search rankings that aren't optimized. If your site is mobile optimized, gold start for you. If you don't know if it is mobile optimized we will be happy to review your site for free and let you know what needs fixing. Just click the button below.</span></p> <p dir="ltr">

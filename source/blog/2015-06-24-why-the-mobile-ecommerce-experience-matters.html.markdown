It seems pretty safe to say that e-commerce is a huge platform. It?s also safe to say that the <em>mobile</em>&nbsp;ecommerce platform is also growing. But just how popular is mobile in terms of e-commerce? If you're selling goods, what are the ramifications of your business for not having an e-commerce site optimized for mobile? Just check the stats. &nbsp;</span></p>

      <li><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-59c56b35-25f0-1bce-80b2-e5adb321bd49">41% of mobile users will abandon a purchase if it?s too difficult to enter in payment information.<br class="kix-line-break"></strong>Again, another reason that user experience is almost everything. If you want to make sure you?re not losing out on sales, the entire process needs to be efficient and streamlined for your customers. Entering payment information is pretty irritating, whether it's on a computer or on a mobile device. However, the latter makes the task that much&nbsp;more tedious. With smaller screens, and a touch-based keyboard, it?s crucial that the process of entering payment information be as fast and easy as possible. The consequence for failing to make this task effortless is lost sales. Out of 100 users, 41 of them will abandon their intended purchases if the payment process is deemed too difficult.</span><br><span style="font-size: 16px;">Source: Harris Interactive, 2014</span></li> 
      <li><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-59c56b35-25ee-97eb-fbaf-1de554bba4a2">Over 50% of online shoppers state the primary reason they?d abandon a shopping cart is due to slow page load times.<br class="kix-line-break"></strong>Going along with the essential theme of providing a wonderful mobile user experience, load time also has an enormous impact. We?ve discussed before that in performing search, <a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/why-is-mobile-optimization-so-important-5-surprising-statistics.html">mobile users typically expect a page to load within 3 seconds</a>, and 75% of users will not wait around for a page with a load time of 5 seconds. These users will leave in search of faster results. This same logic applies to load time and shopping carts. Just because a mobile shopper has added items to a cart and <em>intends</em> on purchasing them doesn?t mean he or she <em>will,</em>&nbsp;if load times are slow.</span><br><span style="font-size: 16px;">Source: <a href="http://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/applicationaccelerationoptimization/2013/05/case-study-page-load-time-conversions/">Radware</a></span></li> 
      <li><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-59c56b35-25ed-b271-e597-b588e96f99a7">When presented with a negative mobile experience, 43% of mobile users will visit a competitor's website.<br class="kix-line-break"></strong>This is huge. If you believe that being provided with a great mobile experience isn?t important to mobile shoppers, think again. If users aren?t provided with a seamless experience from start to finish, they won?t just abandon any items in their shopping cart, <a href="http://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/applicationaccelerationoptimization/2013/05/case-study-page-load-time-conversions/">they will actually feel inclined to visit the website of a competing company</a>! If this isn?t incentive to create a wonderful user experience for customers utilizing smartphones and tablets, then what is?</span></li> 
      <li><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-59c56b35-25eb-967c-8510-a3daa528473d">The number of purchases made via smartphone will rise 8% between now and 2018.<br class="kix-line-break"></strong>Although mobile devices generate more traffic to online retail websites, the amount of actual purchases completed through mobile still lies at only 19%. However, it?s estimated that between now and 2018, that rate will jump nearly 8 percent, and <a href="https://www.internetretailer.com/2014/04/21/mobile-commerce-critical-internet-retailings-future" target="_blank">nearly 27% of users will be completing purchases on their smartphones and tablets</a>.</span></li> 
      <li><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Mobile platforms now contribute to over 50% of online retail traffic.</strong></span><br class="kix-line-break"><span style="font-size: 16px;">According to<a href="http://www.shopify.com/blog/15206517-mobile-now-accounts-for-50-3-of-all-ecommerce-traffic" target="_blank"> data gathered by the Canadian commerce company Shopify</a>, mobile devices now surpass desktop and personal computers in traffic generated to online retail websites. In a study of 100,000 ecommerce stores using Shopify, roughly 50.3% of users were visiting the online retail websites via a mobile device. Forty percent chose to online shop via phone, while just ten percent were shopping on a tablet.</span><span style="font-size: 16px;"></span><span style="font-size: 16px;"></span><span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></li> 
     </ol> <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"></span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Now that mobile accounts for over half of all time spent on retail websites, it?s essential that online users are provided with the best mobile experiences possible. If companies plan on contributing to the 8% rise in <em>actual</em> purchases made online, they need to think about what opportunities they?re providing their customers with. Are they making it easy for customers to shop around for products by ensuring fast load times? And if so, when a customer is ready to purchase, are they making the checkout effortless and fast? If not, there?s a good chance these companies will lose customers to competitors, and will miss out on a significant rise in sales via mobile in the coming years.</span><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Is Your Mobile Site Up To Par?</strong></h3> <p><span style="font-size: 16px;">

The week before, he chaired a webinar on How to Use Technology to Improve Your Bottom Line.</p> <p>Jack, and others, have argued for a long time that customers expect easy-to-use, easy-to-navigate, easy-to-search websites that provide experiences comparable to what they get when they use popular B2C websites (ahem, Amazon). And, let's face it, as a younger generation begins to fill vacancies, those expectations will only rise. Clearly, investing in E-Commerce (and, I'd argue, mobile-optimized commerce) is good for your customers.</p> <p>But it's also good for you. Here are three reasons why.
      <!--more--></p> <h2>Better Information</h2> <p>One of the benefits of E-Commerce platforms is the plethora of detailed information that visitors leave behind. The pages they visit, the paths they follow, the carts they abandon, the pages they spend time on or leave, etc., etc., etc. each give you insight into user behavior that you never had before. Reviewing this information allows you to make better decisions about how to layout your site, what language to use, and what content to provide to whom, so that you can grow your business.</p> <h2>Faster Information</h2> <p>In addition to better information, the data generated by E-Commerce platforms gives you access to faster information. Curious whether you should add a new product line? Create a page for it on your E-Commerce platform, drive some traffic, and see if it converts. You'll be able to tell relatively quickly whether your customers find it compelling or not before you've invested a lot of time and money in a widget nobody wants.</p> <h2>Higher Margins</h2> <p>Of course, with better, faster information, comes the ability to make better decisions that increase your margins. By mapping your E-Marketing campaigns (Email, PPC, etc) to your E-Commerce results, you can see which marketing efforts and which products yield the highest margins and focus on those. Additionally, you can start to offer tailored products to individual users, which further increases your ability to grow sales without sacrificing margins. Finally, tracking real-time, customer-specific data allows you to optimize your operations and supply chain, further reducing waste in your cost structure and growing your margins.</p> <h2>No Excuses</h2> <p>Companies like Hybris and Magento have already built great platforms that give you a working E-Commerce platform out of the box. They've done a lot of work with a lot of companies to make sure that they can handle most use cases. And, for unique use cases, their platforms are familiar enough that a custom developer can add modules as needed. In short, obtaining a high quality, E-Commerce platform isn't nearly as difficult as it used to be. The next frontier, then, is having the ability to mine, aggregate, analyze, and transform all that data into information and insight, so that your business can move forward quickly and intelligently.</p> <p>Your customers are changing and they expect high-quality, easy-to-use E-Commerce experiences from you. That isn't changing. The question is whether you are ready and willing to serve your customers and accelerate your growth.</p> <p>Are you?</p>

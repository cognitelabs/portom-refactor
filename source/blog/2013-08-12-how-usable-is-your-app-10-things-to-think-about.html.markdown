That has changed in the past few years and now users expect smooth, seamless experiences. But what does that mean?</p> <p>While there are a variety of different usability heuristic schemes out there, one of the most popular set of criteria were devised by Jakob Nielson and Rolf Molich in 1990. Although old, they're far from dated and represent a good place to start when thinking about the usability of your app.</p> 
     <!--more--><br> <h2>Visibility of System Status</h2> <p>Users should be informed about what?s going on. Ambiguity about system status causes users anxiety.<br> For example, if a user is logged in, make sure it?s clear that they?re logged in through the use of prompts, referencing their user name, or different menus. If an upload takes a long time, provide a status bar.</p> <h2>Match the System with the Real World</h2> <p>Use words and phrases familiar to the user. In other words, get rid of system codes or technical jargon that don?t mean anything to typical users. For example, instead of having the typical ?404 Error? show up when a user tries to access a page that doesn?t exist, just tell them plainly, ?Sorry, the page you?re looking for doesn?t exist? and offer them a way out.</p> <h2>Give Users Control and Freedom</h2> <p>Users make mistakes. Where possible, give them the freedom to do so by supporting ?undo? or ?redo? operations. You should also have escapes that allow users to backtrack or switch contexts where appropriate. For instance, if you?re going to take users several layers deep in some menus, offer breadcrumbs so that they can get back to the appropriate top-level menu if they so desire.</p> <h2>Use Standards, Be Consistent</h2> <p>This is pretty self-explanatory, I think. Users shouldn?t have to guess what words or icons mean. Use familiar language, and consistent design or platform conventions throughout the entire application.</p> <h2>Prevent Errors</h2> <p>Providing good error messages is one thing. Preventing errors altogether is the moneymaker. Users often click on stuff, especially when feeling out the application for the first time. Do them a favor and prevent disaster by providing tooltips, alerts, or hiding information that may adversely alter state unintentionally. This is especially the case for ?Delete? operations.</p> <h2>Facilitate Recognition rather than Recall</h2> <p>Users shouldn?t have to remember information as it migrates across the system. Nor should they have to copy and paste information from form to form. For instance, if they filled out some information on page 1 of your app and some of that information is necessary on a different page, then auto-populate the information for them.</p> <h2>Facilitate Flexibility and Efficiency</h2> <p>Another reason to observe super-users is to find out the tricks they use to work through the system efficiently. For instance, many users use a mouse to click from field to field or to accomplish tasks. But that might not be the most efficient route; maybe keystrokes or gestures are. By facilitating efficient habits, your users will get more value out of your system.</p> <h2>Minimalist Design</h2> <p>Every pixel should have a purpose. Interfaces cluttered with irrelevant or superfluous information confuse users and detract from the value of the important information on the screen. Provide users only the information they need, at the time they need it.</p> <h2>Help Users Recover from Errors</h2> <p>When users make mistakes, the error messages should be written clearly and offer a way out. Even better, they should empathize with the user and suggest a solution or different course of action based on user intent.</p> <h2>Provide Help and Documentation</h2> <p>Ideally, your system does not require documentation. But, as the userbase grows and edge cases arise, you might need to provide some documentation. Make sure it?s easily accessible, easy to search, and offers concise, concrete guidance that solves the user?s problem.</p> <h2 class="featured-h2">Check out our new (free) ebook!</h2>

This amounts to somewhere around 2 trillion searches per year (yes, that number carries 12 zeros behind it). To put that in incredibly modest terms, Google does a lot of searches. This is an impressive statistic, no doubt. However, if you?re trying to optimize your site for mobile, it?s not enough to just be aware of how many of those 2 trillion search results your website will fall under.
      <!--more--> It is also worth understanding the thought behind those searches, and what users are looking to gain as a result. This will allow you to better tailor your content to align with the intent behind specific search categories, and attract the users you want to attract.It seems simple, but <a href="http://www.skilledup.com/articles/determine-search-intent-type">every one of those 2 trillion searches falls into one of four categories</a>: navigational, informational, commercial, and transactional. These categories encompass characteristics unique to each; most importantly, they vary in terms of value to a business. Let?s take a look at the categories, and examples of each.</span>
     <ol> 
      <li dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 2em;"><strong>Navigational</strong><br class="kix-line-break">Have you ever wanted to go to a website, but didn?t quite know the name? Maybe you wanted to access the website for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, so you type in ?juvenile diabetes research foundation website?. After searching that in Google, the results would show you that the website?s correct domain was ?<a href="http://www.jdrf.org">www.jdrf.org</a>?. The only motivation behind this type of search is to navigate the web in search of the correct domain name. Therefore, this type of search can benefit your business if the user already knows that they want to search for your specific website, but is unlikely to add value otherwise.</span></li> 
      <li dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 2em;"><strong>Informational</strong><br class="kix-line-break">This type of search encompasses all of your run-of-the-mill information searches. Want to know who played the leads in Pulp Fiction? You search ?lead actors in Pulp Fiction?. Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta?s IMDB profiles will pop up, and your question will be answered. This type of search also includes searching recipes, weather, DIY guides, and the like. The defining criteria is that the search is performed to gain information, without any intentions of performing a transaction. Having your content fall under this category is not a bad thing at all, and may help you to become part of the future user?s evoked set. However, the user is not interested in performing any transaction, commercial or otherwise, and any content meant to fall under this category is merely for exposure.</span></li> 
      <li dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 2em;"><strong>Commercial</strong><br class="kix-line-break">Commercial searches fall somewhere between informational and transactional searches because they include searches that COULD end in a transaction, but may not. The major distinction between commercial and informational is that the user searches for commercial purposes. A user may want to research some landscaping companies in the area and comparison shop for the best prices. After all the research they?ve done, they may decide they?re still not ready to move forward with a transaction. They?ve left the search more informed regarding commercial information: services offered, company names, and prices. This is infinitely more valuable to the firm than a navigational search.</span></li> 
      <li dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 2em;"><strong>Transactional</strong><br class="kix-line-break">Transactional searches are the most valuable search for a business. This type of search is not limited to scenarios ending with a monetary transaction. In a transactional search, a user intends to complete an action. Whether it's to sign up for a LinkedIn account, search the address of a pizza joint to eat at later, or purchase a pair of shoes online, the user intends to perform a value-adding activity.</span></li> 
     </ol><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 2em;"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-a6c73dec-4f57-0714-a302-9cd0fa6e3898"><br></strong>Understanding the four types of search is a great starting point to tailoring your SEO and content strategies to attract the audience you want to attract. Knowing the intent behind each type of search can allow you to customize offerings, and focus your efforts in the most valuable places. Whether you are just trying to gain more company exposure (informational search), or you?d like your audience to sign up for a newsletter (transactional search), it?s definitely worthwhile to understand what your users intend to do when searching the web.</span></span>

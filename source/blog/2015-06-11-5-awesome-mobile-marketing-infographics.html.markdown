As with all infographics, the intended purpose is to visually communicate ideas. According to Paul Martin Lester, a professor and former editor of Visual Communication Quarterly, our society is shifting from taking in information by reading, to having a preference for viewing images. Why? Well, beyond infographics (usually) being easy on the eyes, and full of fun facts and interesting figures, they?re simply less work for our often over-stimulated brains to process.</p> 
     <!--more--> <p dir="ltr"><span> Studies have found that people recall around 80% of the information they?ve seen, versus information they?ve read (20%) and heard (10%)</span><span>. Infographics present information visually, thus increasing the rate of retention. Mobile marketers are not exempt from this statistic, and should know what formula will yield a good mobile marketing infographic for two reasons.</span></p> 
     <ol> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Mobile marketers can learn by example, and pick up on what the infographic did correctly to later use in their own visual communication content, such as mobile web design, and advertisements.</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>They can keep up with the latest trends and patterns in the mobile marketing industry.</span></p> </li> 
     </ol> <p dir="ltr"><span>Knowing what works in already existing infographics (by studying them and checking out their features) can help mobile marketers with creating their own content.</span></p> <h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span>5 Awesome Mobile Marketing Infographics</span></h3> 
     <ol> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Text Marketer</span><span>: What?s not to like about this awesome infographic from Text Marketer, a mobile and SMS marketer based out of the UK? From being aesthetically pleasing, to having a great amount of easy-to-read text and readily digestible figures, it definitely gets the job done. The interface provides you with subtly moving illustrations, while highlighting the importance of mobile marketing. The information provided illustrates that smartphone users are now spending more time than ever on their phones, and would even rather give up a week of common activities such as drinking with friends, sex, and eating chocolate, than give up their smartphones. Again, this highlights what a powerful platform mobile marketers have at their disposal, all while treating the eyes to a soft pastel blue background.<img src="https://www.textmarketer.co.uk/images/10_mobile_marketing_Stats_2014.gif" alt="" width="447" style="width: 447px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></p> </li> 
     </ol>
     <ol start="2"> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><span>3Sixty Interactive</span><span>: This infographic, designed by 3Sixty interactive, a social media marketing company from Flint, Michigan, takes a different approach than the first. This infographic focuses on where the user?s search for products begins (yup, on a mobile device!), how users are using their smartphones to make these searches (asking friends via SMS messaging, utilizing web search, looking up product reviews, and comparing prices), and also describes the rate of mobile advertising. The information is bold, concise, and important, and certainly makes for an awesome infographic.<img src="http://cdn.business2community.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Untitled-Infographic-71.jpg1.jpg" alt="" width="424" style="width: 424px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Mobile17</span><span>: Although a tad cluttered, this infographic by Mobile17 gives some great insight into the mobile habits of Android users. When I think mobile, I typically jump to the conclusion that everyone has an iPhone. However, this infographic proves me wrong. It seems that Android actually takes up a whopping 11% more of the smartphone operating system market share than Apple! This infographic goes on to describe the likely demographic of an Android user, and it seems the typical Android customer is a twenty-something American male who likes cheesesteaks paired with a glass of fine Shiraz? who knew? While these facts seem trivial, they aren't to those trying to market Android phones, as it shows how users are typically using their phones(It seems apps are very important to the Android user!)<img src="http://www.designinfographics.com/infographics-images/android-use-an-infographic-by-mobile17-com.png" alt="" width="400" style="width: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Syndacast</span><span>: Syndacast presents a wonderful infographic about current mobile marketing trends for 2015. Although very different in style from the previous examples, this infographic highlights some extremely important trends for the year, including social media marketing, mobile optimization, and content marketing. Syndacast provides the user with detailed information such as what percentage of B2C businesses currently utilize content marketing, and how many plan on taking advantage of the benefits of social media marketing in the future. The hard data jumps out at you thanks to the bold text and the black body text backs up that information. The reader can easily differentiate between the figures, statistics and main takeaways. The overall package is a charming one, brimming with relevant info about the current trends in mobile marketing.<img src="http://syndacast.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Digital-Marketing-Trends-2015_withsource-01.jpg" alt="" width="390" style="width: 390px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>BlueCaribu</span><span>: Our last awesome infographic is one presented by BlueCaribu, a mobile marketing agency in Columbia. Very different in content from the others, this infographic outlines a brief and simplified process for how to successfully promote a mobile app. As we?ve seen in the last few infographics, mobile applications have unquestionably earned a permanent spot on the mobile marketer?s tool belt. But, how does one effectively promote a mobile app? Through fun illustrations, BlueCaribu shows us that it can be as easy as choosing a good name, creating an eye-catching icon, and utilizing other tools of mobile marketers, such as social media&nbsp;and optimization around keywords.<img src="http://www.bluecaribu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Mobile-App-Marketing.png" alt="" width="325" style="width: 325px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></p> </li>

If it's a true vacation, probably (hopefully) slim to none. But, as they are out and about at the lake or at barbecues, they'll most definitely have their mobile devices. And when they need to complete a task, answer a question, or find a service, where will they turn? That's right, their phone.</span></p> 
     <!--more--> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://blog.compete.com/2010/03/12/smartphone-owners-a-ready-and-willing-audience/"><span>Given the results of different studies</span></a><span>, it's clear that smartphones are being used at all points during the day, one way or another. This isn't going to change while on vacation. In fact, it may increase. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>So, what are people doing on their phones and how can you make sure your </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/creating-user-experience-in-a-post-mobilegeddon-world.html"><span>website isn't just mobile optimized, but offers a great experience?</span></a></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Let's take a vacation with Steve and Suzy.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Directions and Food</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>As Suzy and Steve pull out of their driveway, ready to head to the nearest coastal town for a beach getaway, what's the first thing they will do? Probably, get directions. Suzy brings them up on her smartphone, while Steve drives. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>About midway through their trip, they get hungry. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>A glance at the map shows Suzy a restaurant a few miles up that seems promising, but she wants to make sure they are open for lunch. A simple click on the name, right from the map, and she can see reviews, images, directions, hours, a phone number, and a link to the website (if they have one). Within seconds, she knows they are open, they have a patio and that they have some of the best lunch specials in town. One reviewer even encouraged everyone to try their Bloody Mary (which Suzy did). </span></p> <h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong></h3>

Suzy searches for hotels in their destination city and is given a list of options with prices right on the search page. She can see on the map which are beachfront, so she clicks one. Again, she can see a phone number, address and a link to book. But, she wants to know if they have a shuttle service, so she goes to their website. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>It's slow. When it finally loads, the print is so small she can barely read it. She pinches. She zooms. But she can't find amenities without clicking to another page (which loads just as slowly) so she backs out. She could call, but she is already frustrated and approaching town. The next site though, loads quickly, is well-laid out and she finds what she needs with minimal scrolling. She sees they have a shuttle, enters the dates, and finds a room. By the time they reach the city limits, the hotel is booked. She pulls up directions and they pull in a few minutes later. </span></p> <h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong></h3> 
     <ul> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Know how your users will be finding you. If you're a hotel, they are probably using a search engine. Make sure all the information they need will show up where they need it. </span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/5-big-mistakes-youre-probably-making-in-mobile-optimization.html"><span>Don't underestimate how frustrating slow load times can be. </span></a><span>(A 1-second delay in page response can result in a 7% reduction in conversions.) </span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Make sure important information is easy to get to (above the fold) and easy to read.</span></p> </li> 
     </ul> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Change of Plans</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Before Suzy and Steve can unpack, change into their suits and hit the beach, it starts to rain.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Steve checks the weather from his phone and sees it's supposed to continue for the rest of the day; they need a backup plan. A flyer on the desk in their room shows them that the local museum has a special exhibit that interests them both. He pulls up the website to get prices, exhibit times, and tickets. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>On the homepage, he sees a static banner about the exhibit, the print bold and easy to read against the picture in the background. He sees the times it's available and at the bottom of the banner a large, bright button advertising a two for one special on admission, urging him to BUY NOW. He clicks, is taken to a checkout screen (the empty fields easily clickable and big enough to read) and within a minute their tickets are purchased. </span></p> <h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong></h3> 
     <ul> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/62590-five-good-and-five-bad-examples-of-click-to-call-mobile-ctas/"><span>Calls to Actions are just as important on mobile as they are on a desktop</span></a><span>. Offers and a clear action item will get customers to click when they might not have. </span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>When purchasing is involved, make sure the fields are big enough to click on and easy to fill out.</span></p> </li> 
     </ul> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Fun in the Sun</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>The next day, the sun is out and the weather report is promising. Instead of just chilling on the beach, Steve and Suzy decide they want to live large and rent a pontoon boat so they can invite a few of their friends that are staying nearby. After a quick search for rental places near them, they are turned off by a couple bad reviews and some bad sites that make it difficult to get information. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The first site doesn't even fit on the phone screen and a lot of information gets cut off. Another has a large box that looks like it's supposed to have a video. But, it won't load and slows down the rest of the site. The third site is sleek, well-designed, and, as Steve points out, if their site is so nice they must have nice boats. After looking at a few pictures of the boats, reading a few reviews and glancing at their prices, they decide to give them a call and book a boat. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>As soon as they hang up, Steve receives a confirmation email that contains all the information he needs to know about taking out the boat, including a support number if there is something wrong with their reservation, a downloadable receipt, and a coupon for their next rental. "Maybe we should do it again tomorrow," says Suzy upon seeing the deal. &nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>So, they click the coupon, are taken to a booking site, and book another day with the pontoon. Oh, and they tell their friends about the experience. Plus, they write a positive review.</span></p> <h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong></h3> 
     <ul> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/5-big-mistakes-youre-probably-making-in-mobile-optimization.html"><span>Videos aren't always supported on mobile.</span></a><span> Media types, like Flash, will play on a desktop but not a mobile sites. They will also, often, cause slow load times. Use with caution, care, and discretion.</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>If you don't optimize your site for mobile, it simply won't look right on your phone. It won't fit the screen, fonts will be small and hard to read and information will be hard to find. <a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/contact.html">Don't worry, we can help with this.&nbsp;</a></span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Your site says a lot about your company. It's often the first impression people get of your business. Make sure it gives the impression you want people to get. </span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/the-mobile-ecommerce-experience.html">Mobile e-commerce is gaining traction,</a>&nbsp;</span><span>make sure your site can handle purchases.</span></p> </li> 
     </ul> <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Happily Ever After</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Throughout the rest of their trip, Suzy uses her phone from the boat to look up Bloody Mary recipes, find a nearby store when her suit rips (and get the best deal) and find the bar most recommended by the locals using Yelp. Steve looks up how to sync his phone with the radio on the pontoon and finds simple, step-by-step instructions from a site he bookmarks for later use, and looks up the most romantic restaurant in town. He makes a reservation right from the website and is able to surprise Suzy for their last night of vacation.</span></p> <h3 dir="ltr"><span>The Moral of This Story?</span></h3> <p dir="ltr"><span>So, what does the story of Steve and Suzy tell us? That mobile matters, even when on vacation. Knowing</span><span> how and where</span><span> your users will be using your site is important. If you're a boat rental shop in a popular tourist destination, you're going to have competition. Your site should invite users to click as soon as they get to the site. If they can't, they'll go somewhere else. If you're a restaurant, showing up on a map will get you business you may have never gotten. Easy to read sites, clear calls to action, and fast load times will you give your users a productive experience and get you more customers.</span></p> <a href="https://cognitelabs.leadpages.co/leadbox/1414db373f72a2%3A17d7e942bb46dc/5676201666412544/" target="_blank" style="color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; padding: 10px; display: inline-block; max-width: 300px; border-radius: 5px; text-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.247059) 0px -1px 1px; box-shadow: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.498039) 0px 1px 3px inset, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.498039) 0px 1px 3px; background: #e66030;">Download our FREE Guide to Stop Leaking Mobile Leads!</a> <script src="https://cognitelabs.leadpages.co/leadbox-878.js" type="text/javascript" data-leadbox="1414db373f72a2:17d7e942bb46dc" data-url="https://cognitelabs.leadpages.co/leadbox/1414db373f72a2%3A17d7e942bb46dc/5676201666412544/" data-config="%7B%7D"></script></span>

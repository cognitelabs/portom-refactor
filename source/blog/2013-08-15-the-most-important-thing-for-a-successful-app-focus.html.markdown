     <!--more--> <h3>Solve One Problem Well</h3> <p>Good interface design is ultimately about solving an important problem for your users better than any one else has. When users come to your site or use your product, it will be because you help them to do something important faster, cheaper, or easier than anyone else can. Successful products have recognized that. Unsuccessful products do not.</p> <p>Clarity is essential to the design of an effective interface and, by extension, a successful app.</p> <h3>Some Examples</h3> <p>Take Facebook, for example. Why do people use it? Because they want to stay connected to people they care about. So, the interface is designed to facilitate that goal with newsfeeds, timelines, and the prioritization of content. Different from past competitors (myspace, Friendster), the interface was clean and users weren?t distracted by content superfluous to the goal of staying connected.</p> <p>What about Amazon? They have tons of products that can be delivered at a relatively low cost. So, Amazon has a powerful search engine and well-organized catalog. Their recommendation engines help customers to find products they <em>might</em> need, even if they hadn't made the intention explicit, yet. Knowing their customer?s needs, they remain focused on meeting them. (I can?t say the same for the design of some of their cloud services, unfortunately.)</p> <h3>Stay Focused</h3> <p>Focus is hard. And it requires discipline. Unless your app is growing like gang-busters such that angels, VCs, and your cousin Bertha are clamoring to invest tons of money into your product, it's also likely you haven't yet fully clarified the problem you're trying to solve. And that's ok. It?ll take time, especially if it?s going to be done well.</p> <p>But it?s time well invested because focusing relentlessly on the right problem is the difference between a successful app and an unsuccessful one.</p>

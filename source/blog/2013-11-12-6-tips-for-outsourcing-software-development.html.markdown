Many of the folks we work with admit to knowing little or nothing about coding and often struggle to know whether the team they're outsourcing software development to can execute on the project they have in mind. Some have even outsourced software development before and been frustrated with a poor or incomplete product, after losing both time and money. <br><br> In an effort to save some of that frustration, we offer the following six tips for outsourcing software development.</p> 
     <!--more--><br> <h2>Validate Your Idea Before You Hire</h2> <p>Vagueness in software development leads to overruns in both time and cost. Both can be mitigated with a clear product vision and scope. Understanding your users, the <a href="http://cognitelabs.com/got-99-problems-but-i-only-get-one/">problem you?re solving for them</a>, and having validated designs doesn?t require you to know how to code. In fact, we advocate using <a href="http://cognitelabs.com/prototype-ui-quickly-using-paper/">paper prototypes</a> to get user feedback early and often. By the time you're ready for outsourcing software development, your design should be well validated.</p> <p>Not sure how to validate your idea? Check out our free Ebook, <a href="http://cognitelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/a-beginners-guide-to-designing-awesome-apps">A Beginner?s Guide to Designing Awesome Apps</a>.</p> <h2>Work Together to Create the Product Backlog</h2> <p>A software development team is business to build software. While we try hard to understand the intricacies of your business and users, we don?t know them as well as you do. You should work with your developers to create and manage your product backlog in an open and transparent way. Products such as <a href="http://cognitelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/asana.com">Asana</a> or <a href="http://cognitelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/trello.com">Trello</a> make this kind of sharing easy. Even though you're outsourcing software development, as the product manager, ou are a part of the team. As a part of the team, you should insist on access to the team's project management tools.</p> <h2>Insist They Speak Your Language</h2> <p>Your development team should speak your language, rather than expect you to speak code. Every line of code written contributes to a user story or requirement that describes how humans interact with the system or try to solve a problem. These are described in English (or some other human language), before they are translated into code, so this shouldn't be a difficult requirement. Still, many developers use jargon when speaking to their clients. Ask them not to.</p> <h2>Make Sure They Use Automated Tests</h2> <p>Many of the folks we talk to have outsourced software development before. Yet, when we describe the concept of automated tests or our test driven approach to development, they are puzzled by the notion. Automated testing is important for several reasons, not the least of which is to make sure the application is functioning properly. Oftentimes, a seemingly innocuous change in one part of the code could lead to a problem elsewhere. Automated tests allow developers to catch these mistakes early and often. Ensure your team uses them.</p> <h2>Have Smaller, More Frequent Milestones</h2> <p>While a product vision is necessary to make sure that there is a 'true north' for the project, it is a mistake to expect that this vision is the only milestone. Good software development teams use an iterative development approach where they write chunks of code in a time boxed period called a sprint. During these sprints, which last 2-4 weeks, the development team will complete a fixed amount of work, resulting in tested, deployable code that satisfies important business requirements. It doesn't mean that the application will be fully functional, but it should be at least partially so.</p> <p>As the product owner, you should participate in the planning and evaluation of each sprint. You should be directing what tasks get priority during that time period (given the developer?s capacity), evaluating where the team fell short, and helping to reshuffle the product backlog as tasks are completed.</p> <h2>Use Good Technology</h2> <p>Programming languages and frameworks are tools intended to accomplish a goal. While there isn?t a ?best? language or framework, you want to make sure the language or framework is robust and well supported. In most cases, that means open-source with active developer communities and good plugins to reduce the amount of boilerplate or repeatable code that developers have to recreate from scratch.</p> <p>Outsourcing software development can be an intimidating endeavor. By verifying these few things, you can save yourself some real headaches and ensure your product is well-built, on time, and on budget.</p>

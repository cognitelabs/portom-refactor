Or design. No problem. Not only can you still make progress, but your lack of experience may be an asset. Because it can be a costly mistake to pursue app development prematurely (it happens often), we often recommend testing a prototype UI with potential users before contracting designers or developers. And here's the secret: it's not hard to do.</p> 
     <!--more--><br> <h2>The Two Types of Clients We See</h2> <p>Many folks come to us who have interesting product ideas and are looking for a developer to build them an app. In many cases, these folks have a clear idea in their mind's eye about what the app should do, who will use it, and why. Only, when pressed, we often find that they still have quite a few assumptions about the product and users. Unfortunately, the larger the gap between the idea in one's head and a compelling product, the longer and more expensive it is to develop. In most of these cases, we recommend the client focus on <a href="http://cognitelabs.com/user-experience-testing-with-observation/"> observations</a> and <a href="http://cognitelabs.com/user-interviews-and-user-experience-testing/">user interviews </a> until they're confident the app is worth the investment. While it may seem like a cop out, we think this helps them to get more value out of their time and dollars. </p> <p>In other cases, our clients want us to help them build a product for their own internal purposes. Like the folks who want us to help them launch their startup, these folks come to us with an idea of a direction they'd like to go. In many cases, they know the use cases and the industry. It is, afterall, for their own purposes. But, there's still a gap between the general ideas in their head and the code we'll ultimately write. Here, we will offer to get the feedback on their behalf, but still encourage low-fidelity prototypes before contracting to develop a full-blown application.</p> <h2>Prototype UI Quickly Using Paper</h2> <p>A <a href="http://cognitelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Elder" target="_blank">famous military strategist</a> once said that no battle plan survives contact with the enemy. The same thing can be said of an application: no design survives first contact with the user. Because ambiguity is one of the most expensive mistakes people make when contracting developers, it's worth it to reduce that risk by getting user feedback early and often. This allows you to hand your developer (or designer) a validated prototype and reduces the gap between your assumptions or understanding of the product, the user's experience, and the code that has to be written. Which saves both time and money.<br><br> Here's the secret - you can get great feedback quickly, easily, and cheaply <em> without even being a developer.</em> All you need is some paper, markers, scissors, and a willingness to talk to the people you intend to have use your product anyways.</p> <p>This process should not be a stressful, time-consuming endeavor. Rather, remember, you simply want to get your ideas down on paper, then in front of users as quickly as possible. The artifact to the right, for instance, took just a few minutes. The problem it intends to solve is make to it easier for small business owners to increase cash flow by decreasing accounts receivable and aging. Still, it is replete with assumptions. For instance:</p> 
     <ul class="disc left-indent"> 
      <li>That month and year are the right ways to visualize the chart.</li> 
      <li>That outstanding invoices and outstanding balance are the right pieces of information to show on the dashboard.</li> 
      <li>That users want to see the top 5 oldest invoices. Maybe it?s the top 10? Maybe they want it sorted by amount rather than days old?</li> 
      <li>What happens when a user touches ?See All?? The chart?</li> 
      <li>That an iPad is the right viewport. Or even a necessary one.</li> 
      <li>Etc.</li> 
     </ul> <h2>Your Users Know Their Needs</h2> <p>The goal of creating a prototype UI is to gauge user reaction and narrow the gap between their experience and your understanding of what the app should do. As you show the prototype, let the user interact with it and observe their behavior. Where do they look? What do they touch/click/etc.? What questions do they ask?</p> <p>In the example above, for instance, we took a sheet of paper and taped it to an iPad. This allows a user to simulate what it might look like when they?re actually using the product on a mobile device. We could just as easily have used a phone, a different tablet, or a computer. After all, it just takes a little paper, some tape, and some markers to create a prototypical interface!</p> <p>In many cases, it?s often wise to approximate the user?s environment and go through the exercise with a partner. For instance, if the user will primarily be in an office environment, try and do the demo in an office. If they'll be mobile, simulate that environment. Often, the right context helps to unearth a bunch of assumptions that you (or your users!) didn't even realize existed.</p> <p>When showcasing the prototype to users, it?s also useful to have a partner go with you. Because you?ll want to try and simulate the user's experience (which means when the user touches ?See All?, you should be prepared with the next screen they?ll be presented with), it can be difficult to manage the experience, observe their interactions, ask good questions, and take notes by yourself. So, work as a member of a team. At the end of the 'demo', compare notes and be prepared to hand them over to your developer or designer.</p> <p>Designing or developing an app takes time and can be an expensive endeavor. By investing a little bit of time up front with low fidelity prototype UIs made out of paper, you can ensure you're focused on the right problem, reduce the probability of feature creep, and, best of all, create a product that will delight your users.</p>

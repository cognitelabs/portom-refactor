So, how do you do that? You articulate your assumptions about what the problem is you?re trying to solve, then test them for accuracy.</p> 
     <!--more--><br> <h2>You Learned this in Middle School</h2> <p>Remember back in middle school when you learned the Scientific Method? If you were like most of us, your process looked roughly like this:</p> <p><img src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/440551/file-1740137632-jpg/blog-files/scientific_method.jpg?t=1441046336424"></p> <p>The process of identifying the right problem to solve is very similar. In this case, though, you?re going to treat your assumed problem statements as the hypotheses, and will design experiments to test them. Here, we?re going to focus on generating the statements that will later be tested.</p> <h2>An Exercise in Hypothesis Generation</h2> <p>The best way to learn how to do this is by just doing it. So, that?s what we?re going to do.</p> <p>First, get your co-founder, partner, or another trusted advisor (we recommend you don?t do this alone ? 2+ heads are better than one!), some sticky notes, and some Sharpies. We?ll wait. Got them? Good.</p> <p>Now, write as many one-sentence problem statements as you can that describes the universe of problems you intend to solve. Use real sentences, visualize a specific user, and identify the benefit you?re providing that user.</p> <p>Set a specific amount of time (maybe 20-30 minutes), as well as an expectation for the minimum number of ideas you intend to generate in that time period (maybe 25-30). Aim to maximize both; that is, take full advantage of the time and write as many statements as you can in the articulated time frame. </p> <p>The goal is to come up with as many potential problem statements as you can. More is always better here. </p> <h2>You may have an ugly baby</h2> <p>Most of us don?t like being told our baby is ugly. This is also true of our creative pursuits ? you know, the ones that predicated your product idea in the first place.</p> <p>Having multiple problem statements makes it much easier to approach hypothesis testing dispassionately. It becomes easier to compare candidate hypothesis with one another and test which statements matter most. Liberating the emotional element and framing tests as a competition will allow you to go further, faster. </p> <p>And your users will thank you for it.</p>

Oftentimes, we envision - and design around - what it will look like in it's 'best case' scenario: full of data and/or interesting visualizations. It's important to remember that there are at least three states we need to be aware of - and plan for - if we want to create a great user experience.<br> 
      <!--more--></p> <h2>The Initial State</h2> <p>Most applications, when initially fired up for brand new users, have little or no user-specific data. Maybe the user needs to key in or upload data. Or, perhaps, they need to go through some series of steps to configure their profiles or accounts. Whatever the scenario, it's important to remember - and plan - for this initial state. Things like wizards, clearly labeled buttons, and instructions help to orient users and guide them towards what they need to do next. This reduces the friction associated with configuring an application for the first time and helps to make your users' experience that much better.</p> <h2>The Base State</h2> <p>The base state is the state we generally think of when designing interfaces. It's the state that demonstrates the full value the system offers when things are going well. These interfaces reflect data, charts, connections, etc. - all the things that will make this app totally killer. It's the part we tend to spend most of our time on: reflecting back to the user the awesomeness of the app's value proposition. Have fun with it.</p> <h2>The Error State</h2> <p>Errors happen for a variety of reasons. When designing interfaces, it's important to remember the error state and to provide a mechanism to help users recover from errors. Ideally, we provide specific guidance (which piece of information was invalid - the email address or the password?!) as to the cause of the error. At a minimum, though, we want to make sure let users know that something has gone wrong and then point them in the right direction.</p> <p>When designing interfaces, we love to visualize and anticipate how awesome the app will be when the fullness of our vision is realized. That's a good thing and it's a lot of fun. However, planning for the initial state (where there is no data) and the error state (where something has gone wrong) are equally important to designing a good user experience. Considering these states when doing interface design will help to increase the likelihood that users will get to experience the fullness of the vision we ultimately have for them.</p>

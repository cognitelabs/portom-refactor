Mobilegeddon sounds scary, but it is a good thing. It makes Google searches more useful to those on mobile devices by prioritizing mobile friendly websites to mobile searchers. Makes perfect sense right?</p> 
     <!--more--> <p dir="ltr"><span>Well yeah it is nice for users, but it can be a pain for businesses who are unprepared. Having a mobile responsive site is no longer a nice to have. It is now a must have, but your customers will thank you.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Context - Rankings and Mobile Traffic Trends</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>You know your website needs to rank highly in Google to be found right? You know you are using your phone, iPad more and more right? If you said wrong then please tell me you see your sons/daughters/nieces/nephews are using their phones all the time.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Mobile traffic is growing and mobile search is growing. Here is a shocker: </span><a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Mobile-Search-Will-Surpass-Desktop-2015/1011657" target="_blank"><span>Mobile Search is going to surpass desktop search</span></a><span> this year (2015).</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Mobilegeddon Hit, What is it?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Mobilegeddon is a change in the way Google ranks search results. Websites that don?t deliver a good experience to mobile searchers don?t rank as high as they used to. Seems fair right? It is fair and it makes sense, but it is devastating for some (</span><a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/top-winners-and-losers-of-googles-mobile-friendly-update/131531/" target="_blank"><span>like NBC Sports 28% drop</span></a><span>) and awesome for those who were prepared (</span><a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/top-winners-and-losers-of-googles-mobile-friendly-update/131531/" target="_blank"><span>like tvtropes.org?s 420% increase</span></a><span>)</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Is My Site Being Penalized?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>The fastest way to know if Google is penalizing your site is to use their handy </span><a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/?utm_source=wmc-blog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mobile-friendly" target="_blank"><span>mobile friendly test</span></a><span> tool. You give it your site's web address and hit go. It takes less than 2 minutes.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The results can be full of tech jargon, although green is good and red is bad. Here is our site acing the test:</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><img src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/440551/mobile-friendly-test.png?t=1441046336424" alt="mobile-friendly-test"></p> <strong><strong><br></strong></strong> <p dir="ltr"><span>If your site fails the test you get a red fail mark and it has helpful tips telling you how to fix it. We have found lots of sites that fail, but like my mom said ?if you don?t have anything nice to say don?t say anything at all.? so I won't show those sites.</span></p> <p dir="ltr">If you want don't understand Google's results or want to have a mobile web expert review your site click the red button below and we'll be happy to review your site and quickly report back to you.</p> <p dir="ltr">

      <!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Is My Site Ranking Differently?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Another way to tell if this update is impacting your site is to view your analytics or have your IT department view them. Most website analytic packages can split out the data by device. The Google mobile update rolled out in April. If you see a drop in April mobile traffic it is probably because of mobilegeddon.</span></p> <strong><strong><br><br></strong></strong> <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr"><img src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/440551/mobilegeddon-traffic-impact.png?t=1441046336424" alt="mobilegeddon-traffic-impact"></p> <strong><strong><br></strong></strong> <p dir="ltr"><span>By now you should be in one of two places:</span></p> 
     <ol> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>You are happy because you were unaffected or even benefitted from mobilegeddon. Congrats and </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=gold+star" target="_blank"><span>gold star for you</span></a><span>!</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>You are thinking ?Crap! How do I fix this?? Read on my friend, read on.</span></p> </li> 
     </ol><strong><strong><br></strong></strong> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>How do I Get My Traffic Back?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>If you have an IT department responsible for your website, alerting them to the issue may be enough to resolve the issue (hopefully in a timely manner). If they have questions you can point them to this article and we are always happy to take a look.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>If you are the IT department, or at least are responsible for the website, be prepared to dive into tech-land for the next couple of minutes.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>First, the question to ask is how does a website change it?s appearance based on device? The answer to that riddle is that when web browsers (like Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, etc.) use a web page, they provide information both to the website they are asking for the page and to the code on the page. If that doesn?t make sense, here is what my browser gives to websites when it first asks for a webpage.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><img src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/440551/whats_my_user_agent.png?t=1441046336424" alt="whats_my_user_agent"></p> <strong><strong><br></strong></strong> <p dir="ltr"><span>A wesbite has all of the above information to make decisions on what to provide you.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>This enables website owners to provide a different experience for unique visitors. In fact you could provide a completely different webpage to iPad visitors, Android visitors, iPhone visitors, etc. You could also provide completely different pages to Internet Explorer users or to Mac vs. PC users.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Are Those Customizations Useful?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Absolutely. Different platforms have different demographics. Being able to provide customized content that speaks to the person behind the device will improve conversions. Savvy websites like Orbitz have </span><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304458604577488822667325882" target="_blank"><span>changed the sort order on search results</span></a><span> to place higher priced items first for Mac users since they know these users spend 30% more on hotels.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Are Those Customizations Hard?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Unfortunately content or behavior changes based on the hardware and software requires software development skills unless your platform supports it. If you want to see what your browser is sending websites, visit this webpage to </span><a href="http://whatsmyuseragent.com/" target="_blank"><span>immediately see your user agent string</span></a><span>. I used that website to generate the User Agent Graphic above.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Lots of info, right? Unfortunately, like I said, if your platform doesn?t support mobile responsivenes and you don?t have coding skills it is going to be hard to use that information.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The big problem (maybe the biggest) with customized experiences for each device is cost. It costs a lot to create custom content, it complicates the site (added cost), and developers are expensive. It only makes sense if the results justify the cost. If you get 100 visitors per month and you convert 10% of them to customers at $10K per sale then yeah a 5 percent lift is going to add up quickly. If you get 100 visitors per month and convert 10% of them to customers at $5 per sale then it won?t make sense to expend a lot of resources lifting conversions 5%.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Enter responsive web design.</span></p> <strong><strong><br></strong></strong> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Responsive Web Design</span></h2> <strong><strong><br></strong></strong> <p dir="ltr"><img src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/440551/cognite-different-devices.png?t=1441046336424" alt="cognite-different-devices"></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The next best thing to a completely customized experience is one that changes the way a website is laid out without changing the content. Imagine a book like Harry Potter. That book can be viewed on a Kindle, iPad, hardcover, softcover, or even through an audio book. The same content just presented differently. Responsive web design takes that same idea and applies it to web pages.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Responsive design means the design responds to the device it is being presented on. Users shouldn?t be squinting their eyes, pinching, and scrolling to read your awesome content. They should be able to quickly and easily find what they are looking for. Worst of all they shouldn?t be showered with huge slow ads.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Mobile websites have the opportunity to be ultimately convenient. A lof of mobile browsing might happen while driving (not recommended), at parties, in the doctors office, etc. Mobile users should be delighted with how fast and easy to navigate your site is. Not be frustrated and abandon their task. They will love you for it, I promise.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>But I Don't Have EVERY device!</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Some of us techies have lots of devices. Heck even a lot of users have a tablet, phone, and laptop, but no one has all the devices. So how do you know what your site looks like?</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>There are literally thousands of combinations of devices, orientations, operating systems, and browsers out there. Each combination can result in a different look for your site. </span><a href="https://www.browserstack.com/screenshots" target="_blank"><span>BrowserStack</span></a><span> will show you how your site looks on any of those combinations in minutes without you needing to spend thousands of dollars to procure and test the combination.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure your site works for the major browsers (Chrome, IE, Safari, FireFox) and any specific combinations you see in your analytics. Don?t worry about combinations none of your site visitors are using.</span></p> <strong><strong><br></strong></strong> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Want More Help?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Sorry thats all I?ve got! Just kidding, I?d love to provide more help.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>This post covered the basics and provided some tools to help your site delight mobile users. If you want specific recommendations for your site I?ll be happy to review your mobile site for free:</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span></span>

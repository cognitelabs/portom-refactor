Once we have the stories, though, how do we prioritize them?</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>While we?re comfortable using Trello, Jira, or any other project management tool (often dictated by the needs of our clients), we prefer to use Asana. It?s easy to set up, easy for both business and technical stakeholders to use, and it?s robust feature set makes it easy to <span itemprop="about">write and prioritize user stories</span> .</span></p> 
     <!--more--> <p dir="ltr"><span>Here?s how we approach it.</span></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>Before We Start Prioritizing: Organize the Project into Lists</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>Asana is built for teams. It?s a core organizing principle. Teams have projects and projects have tasks. To prevent confusing a ?project? in Asana?s nomenclature with the idea of a ?project?, meaning an initiative for which we?ve been hired, I?ll refer to Asana?s projects as ?lists.? So, with this terminology, I?d say that teams have lists and lists have tasks.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>While there are many different ways to organize lists for a given team, we typically have at least four:</span></p> 
     <ol> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>User Stories or Product Backlog - the master list of user stories that need to be developed over the course of the engagement.</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Current Sprint - the list of stories relevant for the current sprint.</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Bugs - tasks or stories that are buggy and need to be addressed.</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Releases - The major/key features necessary, from the client?s perspective, that need to be completed in the given phase of work.</span></p> </li> 
     </ol> <p dir="ltr"><span>Organizing tasks this way makes it easy to see what?s where and be able to keep track of the different elements of the project.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><img src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/440551/file-2413282753-png/blog-files/asana_screenshots/project-list-in-asana.png?t=1441046336424" width="238px;" height="108px;" alt="software-development-project-list-in-asana" title="software-development-project-list-in-asana" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" itemprop="image"></span></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>Create User Story Cards Using Tasks and Subtasks</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>After the team of relevant stakeholders has contrived the user stories, whether on notecards,&nbsp;<a href="/writing-user-stories-template-download" target="_blank">from a template</a>,&nbsp;</span><span>or </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/writing-good-user-stories-from-wireframes-in-5-simple-steps.html" itemprop="isBasedOnUrl"><span>based on wireframes</span></a><span>, we input them into Asana. One of the great features of Asana is that subtasks nest arbitrarily deep, so we?ll first enter all of the user stories as tasks into the User Story list we?ve created for the project.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Once the tasks are entered, we use subtasks to reflect other important elements of a user story card: the relevant acceptance tests, state requirements, more detailed contextual information and so forth, depending on the story. In some cases, once we start working, we?ll find ourselves in the weeds and realize we need to break the story down even further. So, we might add a substory that needs to be implemented. It?s in these cases that I?m particularly grateful for Asana?s flexibility, because we might want to add subtasks to that substory, which is really easy to do in Asana.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>To identify distinctions in these disparate elements (acceptance tests, state requirements, etc), we use Asana?s </span><a href="https://asana.com/guide/help/projects/sections" itemprop="isBasedOnUrl"><span>sections</span></a><span> feature. This allows for a visual separation of elements that makes it easy to see subtasks in context. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><img src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/440551/file-2417534645-png/blog-files/asana_screenshots/user-story-card-in-asana.png?t=1441046336424" width="494px;" height="506px;" alt="user-story-card-in-asana" title="user-story-card-in-asana" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" itemprop="image"></span></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>Group Like Stories into Sections</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>Once we?ve turned user stories into tasks and subtasks in Asana, we?ll order the user stories into meaningful groupings, called Epics. Epics are a collection of related user stories, often scoped to persona (though not always). Think of epics as mega-stories. It?s the difference between the </span><a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Knightfall" itemprop="url"><span>Knightfall arc</span></a><span> (epic) and </span><a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Batman_Vol_1_497" itemprop="url"><span>Bane breaking Batman</span></a><span> (user story). Or, if you?re more a Harry Potter fan, the series is an epic, while the Goblet of Fire is a story.&nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Again, we use Asana?s section feature to distinguish epics, though for a sufficiently large project, we might use multiple lists to reflect different epics. One of the great things about Asana is that as we drag and drop user stories (tasks) into different sections, all of the subtasks, notes, comments, due dates, assignments, etc. come with it. So, reshuffling is a cinch.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><img src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/440551/file-2417534655-png/blog-files/asana_screenshots/user-story-epics-in-asana.png?t=1441046336424" width="648px;" height="410px;" alt="user story epic in asana" title="user story epic in asana" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" itemprop="image"></span></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>Prioritize Stories and Epics based on Risk, Effort, and Value</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>Now, the meat of prioritization. When we?re prioritizing user stories, we tend to think about three things:</span></p> 
     <ul> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Which stories/epics add the most value to the user?</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Which stories/epics reflect the greatest technical risk (e.g., we?re not really sure if - or how hard - a particular story will be to complete)</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Which stories/epics reflect the biggest business risk (e.g., are there features whose absence can impact the bottom line)?</span></p> </li> 
     </ul> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Which User Stories Add the Most Value to the User (or customer)?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>It?s tempting to focus on product features and to imagine the myriad things that we can build. Only, ?if we build it, they will come? is a farce. Users engage products that add value and we like to work on projects where that value is clear, at least to the client.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>In many cases, this question is the core, guiding question: which features play the biggest role in solving their core problem? If the software could only accomplish one thing for the user, what would it be?</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>That question alone can help to focus efforts tremendously. </span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Which Stories Pose the Most Technical Risk?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>One of the reasons user stories need to be written collaboratively with developers is because this can be a very hard, or even impossible, question for a non-technical expert to answer. But a developer, involved in the conversation, aware of the context, and the business problem being solved, will have an opinion about this.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Depending on the business value of the technically challenging feature, it may be necessary to budget a prototyping sprint or reprioritize the feature, or nix it altogether.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Which User Stories Post the Most Business Risk?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>There is a subtle, but important, distinction between features that provide the most value to a user and ones that may pose the most value to a business. Take, for example, a requirement where a user can read a feed of posts from people they?re friends with or follow. The value to that user is the ability to keep informed or in touch.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>From the perspective of the business, though, they might rely on posting ads in the feed as a source of monetization. So, being able to display ads might be an important feature because, without it, there?s no revenue. </span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Use a Scale to Rank Value</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Asking those questions of the different stories and epics will start a conversation that, in and of itself, will start to determine priorities. At the very least, the conversation will start to help deprioritize unimportant features.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>For the remaining user stories, it?s helpful to rank them along those dimension using a scale. This allows for relative distinctions to be made: just </span><span>how important</span><span> is feature x relative to feature y? A typical scale used in industry is a Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. This scale is useful because it can be easier to answer the question, ?is feature x, ranked ?8?, really 8 times more important than feature y, ranked ?1??</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Concretely, this might look something like Feature X has a User Value of 5, a Technical Risk of 1, and a Business Value of 8. Feature Y has a User Value of 1, a Technical Risk of 8, and a Business Value of 3. Which one would you work on first?</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>In Practice</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>In the past, we?ve added brackets to tasks, kind of like this:</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><img src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/440551/file-2420134522-png/blog-files/asana_screenshots/user-story-brackets-in-asana.png?t=1441046336424" width="720px;" height="73px;" alt="user story bracket in asana" title="user story bracket in asana" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" itemprop="image"></span></p> <span><span><br></span></span> <p dir="ltr"><span>But, in practice, we don?t often need to be that formal. Really, the conversation is the important thing. At the end of the prioritization conversation, we?ll have moved user stories or even entire epics into the ?Current Sprint? list, so it?s clear what we?ve selected as the most important work at that time. &nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Instead, what we?ll often do is append Asana?s </span><a href="https://asana.com/guide/help/connect/tags" itemprop="isBasedOnUrl"><span>tags</span></a><span> to stories that reflect priority and/or technical risk. For instance, we use the label ?Potential Issue? on stories where we think the technical risk might be a ?5? or ?8.? Similarly, we?ll tag stories ?low? or ?top?, based on whether the business or user value is ?1? or ?8.? Because, in our experience, it?s often often easy to tell what?s unimportant and what?s the most important, but the median values are more fungible. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span><img src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/440551/file-2420134527-png/blog-files/asana_screenshots/user-story-card-tags-in-asana.png?t=1441046336424" width="491px;" height="212px;" alt="user story card tag in asana" title="user story card tag in asana" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" itemprop="image"></span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Still, we go through the exercise of asking the questions and, if we find it?s unclear during the course of the conversation, we?ll go back to a more ordered ranking. In other words, we don?t always have to be so regimented, but it?s nice to have a process in the back pocket that we can use, if needed.</span></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>Collaborate and Communicate</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>As the project goes underway, and we start executing sprints, priorities often shift. This is especially the case if the client is doing customer discovery and getting feedback about what?s most important to him or her.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The dynamism of development means that it?s important to have frequent check-ins with the relevant stakeholders to make sure that the right work is being done. At the very least, it?s important to review work and shuffle the deck at the end of every sprint. In many cases, though, weekly check-ins are necessary. For a really fast-moving team, it may happen more frequently.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Regardless, user story prioritization can?t happen in a vacuum; it?s a team effort. Regardless of the tool you use, at the core of prioritization is communication and collaboration. It?s the only way to know whether the work being done is the most important work for the user and the business.</span></p> <h3><span>Need Help Writing User Stories?</span></h3> <p><span itemprop="offers">

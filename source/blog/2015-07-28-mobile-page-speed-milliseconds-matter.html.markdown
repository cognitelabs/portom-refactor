That's ONE second! Mobile users are looking for speed and convenience--if a page takes too long to load, they?ll abandon it and go somewhere else. Optimizing for speed is essential to ensure that users will engage (and stay engaged!) with your content.</span></p> 
     <!--more--> <p dir="ltr"><span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span><span>Around </span><a href="http://e-commercefacts.com/research/2011/07/what-usrs-want-from-mobil/19986_WhatMobileUsersWant_Wp.pdf"><span>60% of mobile users say they expect a page to load in 3 seconds or less</span></a><span>. If wait time happens to fall in the 5 second range, 75% of users say they will abandon the site. If the goal is to have mobile users engage with your site, time is clearly of the essence. Although it seems trivial to hang on every second of the process, even a 1 second delay can reduce the rate of conversions by 7%! (</span><a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/"><span>source</span></a><span>)</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Page load times are a bit more complex than meets the eye. Plenty of factors go into how fast a page will load, including strength of network connection (3G vs 4G). Strength of network is arguably the most important factor in determining page load time. Unfortunately, there isn?t much that can be done to modify this. It?s safe to assume that on a 3G network, around</span><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/mobile"><span> 600 milliseconds of time will be eaten up by the network</span></a><span>. From the time the user enters an address in the browser and clicks ?Go?, to the time the network responds and the page begins loading, 60% of your 1 second window has been used. It?s important to keep this in mind, and use the remaining 400 milliseconds wisely.</span></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>Optimize For Speed</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>What can you do to ensure you?re not losing potential customers and conversions due to slow load times? Optimizing for faster speed is key. Although not much can be done regarding network delays, there?s plenty that can be done to ensure that content loads quickly (once the network responds), including creating Above The Fold (ATF) content, limiting the number of times your page redirects, and minimizing Javascript and CSS in ATF content.</span></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>Stay Above The Fold</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>Consider Above The Fold content for your site. The concept behind ATF content is that a user will be more inclined to stay on a website if at least </span><span>some</span><span> content loads within 1 second. Giving users something to look at while the rest of the page loads gives them the opportunity to interact with the page, and begin preliminary steps to taking some form of action that can ultimately lead them to convert. </span></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>Less Is More</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>In creating ATF content, it?s important to limit the number of times your page redirects, and minimize Javascript and CSS. It takes approximately 200 milliseconds each for the server to process the DNS lookup, establish a TCP connection, and respond to the server request, resulting in at least 600 milliseconds of time being used each time a site redirects. In order to save this precious 600 milliseconds, limit page redirects, or ideally, have none at all. Also, when it comes down to actually writing code for content, it?s important to minimize the number of CSS and Javascript references&nbsp;or add non-blocking CSS and Javascript. In doing so, content can load right away. If you need it, </span><a href="https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/weight-wait.html"><span>here is a much more in depth look at how this process works. </span></a></p> <h1 dir="ltr"><span>Milliseconds Matter</span></h1> <p dir="ltr"><span>The most important thing to keep in mind when worrying about speed&nbsp;is just how important those 600 milliseconds are. While it may not seem like a lot of time, it?s critical to plan around that, and optimize where you can.&nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>By implementing the above-mentioned features, creating ATF content, and optimizing how well it loads, you can make sure that those milliseconds aren't losing you leads. By giving users the ability to interact with your site, even before everything is loaded, you can keep them on the site longer and get them the information they are looking for.&nbsp;</span></p> <br><br></span>

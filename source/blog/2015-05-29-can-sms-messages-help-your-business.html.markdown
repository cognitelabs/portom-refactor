Well, would you believe me if you hadn?t read the title?</p> 
     <!--more--><p dir="ltr"><span>There are so many ways to reach customers and prospects today. Email, phonecallls, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. Technology is also making it easier to reach out to customers through those channels. In 2014 MailChimp sent over 330 MILLION emails per day. This deluge of communication overwhelms people. A lot of business owners I talk to don?t read emails unless they recognize the sender.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>What Few are Doing</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Have you heard companies are using SMS (text messaging) to interact with customers? SMS is a communication channel with a </span><a href="http://www.tatango.com/blog/sms-open-rates-exceed-99/"><span>90% open rate</span></a><span> within 3 minutes of sending. </span><a href="http://www.tatango.com/blog/sms-open-rates-exceed-99/"><span>Overall open rates are 99%</span></a><span> according to Tatango.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Can you imagine seeing open rates that high? I know a lot of marketers would be thrilled with 25% open rates 99% is unheard of.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Great Power Great Responsibility</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Text messages do have high open rates, but with this power comes great responsibility. If you use text messaging irresponsibly it will hurt your brand instead of help it.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Two weeks ago a salesperson text messaged me in the middle of dinner. Fortunately I turn off my phone at family time, but it bothered me. Why are they texting me I thought? We aren?t friends. I know they?ve emailed me so are they just hoping I?ll buy? It also bothered me because I felt I should respond, but I was incensed at what I saw as a personal invasion into my space.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>How Uber uses Text Messaging</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Honestly I didn?t even realize they did text messaging until I started thinking about this space more. They made the experience so smooth and seamless I had forgotten it even happens. When their drivers are running late or need to communicate with you they often send short SMS messages. This is awesome because often times city streets or airports are loud difficult places for a conversation. SMS makes for crystal clear communications. No accents, phone cutouts, or background noise to make hearing difficult. For short messages with no questions SMS is awesome.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The key takeaway from contrasting these scenarios is that text messaging can improve the customer experience. Done properly it can make customers like you better. Another example is with stock trading. In the past I?ve wanted to be notified immediately when a buy order is filled and at what price. Text Messaging is perfect for that. A message could say ?Filled: Buy 5 AAPL @ 132.04? Short, convenient, timely, perfect.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Ideas You can Use</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>You probably aren?t a stock broker or a transportation company. How can you use text messaging? Here are some more generic examples:</span></p> 
     <ol> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Do you like waiting on hold? Neither do your customers! What if you let customers SMS you and then you called them when you were ready to handle their call. Wait times to 0</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Do you like sharing personal details (maybe financial or health related) in front of groups of people? Neither do your customers! I have seen presentations that enable audience members to ask highly personal questions or share highly personal details anonymously.</span></p> </li> 
      <li dir="ltr"> <p dir="ltr"><span>Have you ever gotten a speakers contact info wrong? Many speakers have contact info at the end of their slides. Email addresses can be hard to get right on mobile phones and it can take a long time to open the email app, click compose, think of a subject, enter their email address, put something in the body, etc. Wouldn?t it be easier to text a 9 digit number with your email address? How long would that take 30 seconds? Less?</span></p> </li> 
     </ol> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Don?t Use SMS to Spam</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>People love their phones because of the ultimate convenience. Internet everywhere, communication anywhere. Jamming messages down people?s throats is the opposite of convenience and will hurt your brand. Ensure people want the interaction with you (opt in) and ensure it benefits their life like the two examples above.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>No Really Don?t Spam</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>If you don?t mind angry customers another reason not to spam is the Telephone Consumer Protection Act is to avoid time with lawyers. Violations of the TCPA can result in $1,500 per text message. There are frequent TCPA court cases as you can see on the </span><a href="http://tcpablog.com/"><span>TCPA blog</span></a><span>.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Happy Texting</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>That?s it, think how can text messages help my customer, make sure they opt in, and don?t break the law.</span></p>

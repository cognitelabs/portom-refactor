You’re ready to start the development process. So, what’s next?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>One of the biggest sources of anxiety we see when getting ready to undertake a new software development project is getting one’s arms around the process of estimating the amount of work it’ll take to build the product. Unfortunately, every application is different and, especially at the idea or concept stage of development, it’s really difficult to provide a </span><span>good estimate of the amount of time or effort it will take to ship the product</span><span>.</span></p>
<!--more-->
<p dir="ltr"><span>Done well, </span><a href="/blog/writing-user-stories-to-build-great-apps" itemprop="isBasedOnUrl"><span itemprop="about">writing good user stories</span></a><span> is a good way to demystify the app development process, while also providing a tool for software estimation and planning. But, they can be hard to do if you aren’t used to doing it. Here are few common pitfalls to avoid. Do so, and REST Easy.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A quick note, to provide some context, the examples will refer to this wireframe, derived from our upcoming application to help make it easier to create user personas:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/CD6Pog9HcOktKPIJgqWQ2EsL83ciGS6SBzfLDfFIvq--WExn1aDKai7J-43_deiY-06IlNbOguUNccUv2tMN5NXXdYlUAc2t6dvfNbX1YyZ8HtdvpEDvTt2wc3wOFMuKDA" width="720px;" height="1757px;" alt="user-story-wireframe" title="user-story-wireframe" itemprop="image"></span></p>
<h1 dir="ltr"><span>1. The User Story is Too BIG or Too small</span></h1>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Remember the story of Goldilocks? The one who finds a hut in the woods where a family of bears is living? She tries some porridge, some chairs, a bed and, in every case, one is too big, one is too small, and the other is juuuust right? That’s the one.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Goldilocks’ propensity for trespassing, blatant disregard for property rights, and sense of entitlement notwithstanding, there is a point for our user stories. They should be sized juuuust right.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>An example of a User Story that’s too big</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Take this user story, for example:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zepS4Tun8sTZ06755C6RUfjN7YgYFGNx_5kS6VNZVlVGspC5TdMVEBuyH1WVKekURe9QrtlXPh6d_ZTH3vZ_BU04nmJn28RWG_R_thnMqlw2OHHpIFMCL5CXJSriJm5G0w" width="720px;" height="432px;" alt="user-story-example-too-large.png" itemprop="image"></span></p>
<span><span><br></span></span>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Whoa, that’s a lot!</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The story encompasses too many dependencies, covers too much ground and is hard to estimate. It’s too broad and leaves open questions like “how are job and role different?”, “what is meant by ‘which technologies matter?’ Aren’t operating systems technologies, after all?” .</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For large user stories, it often makes sense to split them up into smaller, clearer, more manageable chunks. For instance, we might might consolidate the “name”, “job,” “role”, and “bio” fields into a single story: “As a user, I want to enter a persona’s meta-information, so that I can understand his context at a glance.” The revised story becomes easier to understand and easier to estimate.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>A User Story is Too Small</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Here’s an example of a user story that’s too small:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uaMGxvJJIiWL9UsXvtoQxFeGTwowWljlMMasYTxbIjVMq-DEh9IGKfvEhH4Z1X0-0ax_NZ1UFUq3y_An8GQ-gK3iAEyqGxUZviCnleIIe_jKugLak7K6sCVRgsS_Z6Y4FQ" width="720px;" height="432px;" alt="user_story_example_too_small.png"></span></p>
<span><span><br></span></span>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In this case, the story is too small. It’s a trivial task and doesn’t represent a meaningful level of work for a developer. I’d probably argue that it doesn’t represent a lot of real value to the user. But, it may, in context. In this case, therefore, we’d probably want to combine it with some other stories, to create a more meaningful one. </span></p>
<h1 dir="ltr"><span>2. The User Story Can’t Be Estimated</span></h1>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Another pitfall to avoid is creating stories that can’t be estimated. As previously mentioned, having a story that’s too large can make it impossible to estimate the level of effort involved. But, there are other reasons why estimating might be impossible, too:</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>A Developer Lacks Domain Knowledge</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It is highly unlikely that a developer knows your business as well as you do. In order to provide a reasonable estimate, they need to learn and understand your business. Or, at the very least, the business case. Having context will help them to ‘read between the lines’ and make better choices on your behalf, when it’s time to write code. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In many ways, writing user stories helps to facilitate these very conversations. They are, after all, communication tools. By their nature, they help your developer better understand your domain and your users. As you discuss the stories, their domain knowledge increases and it becomes easier to estimate.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>A Developer Lacks Technical Expertise</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I’m going to let you in on a little secret...no developer knows </span><span>everything</span><span> about </span><span>every</span><span> technology. It changes quickly. Different use cases might require the use of different tools, some of which the developer might not be an expert on, for any number of reasons. Or, your application might be pushing the envelope of how a specific technology has been used before. The developer may have a good hypothesis about the best way to approach it, but isn’t certain.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In these cases, it helps to have a dedicated sprint for the purpose of doing a quick, exploratory prototype to a) get more familiar with the technology and b) determine the level of effort that is likely going to be necessary. Both of which help to facilitate the writing of an estimable user story.</span></p>
<h1 dir="ltr"><span>3. The User Story isn’t Testable</span></h1>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This is an example of a user story that is not testable:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ApgRbWVTWt0p2FF2uT4c9kxdLoYWflqPzoT_NwoA3RLWfUFysTHUTJvlig1mb9rNzFkuqqE_C3DCbChmWyO2jWEm8KrPu67tNUoT2WOVXONYZieyzdlINwKfXLLayjSl6w" width="720px;" height="432px;" alt="untestable-user-story-example.png" itemprop="image"></span></p>
<span><span><br></span></span>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For a user story to be testable, we have to know what ‘done’ looks like. In this case, how do we measure ‘awesome?’ How do we measure ‘responsive?’ Do we mean, ‘responsive’ as in ‘fast?’ Or ‘responsive’ as in ‘works on a variety of devices?’</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It’s not clear. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Good user stories are ones that can be tested and have clear criteria for “done.” In fact, it’s how we know the requirement is ‘done’; the test passes!</span></p>
<h1 dir="ltr"><span>REST Easy</span></h1>
<p dir="ltr"><span>When crafting user stories, it is important to REST easy. That is, we want to make sure that our user stories are:</span></p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Relevant</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Estimable</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Small</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Testable</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Relevant</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It almost goes without saying, but is so important it’s worth repeating, user stories should be relevant to a specific user or purchaser. This is why we advocate user interviews and observations, even if you are already a domain expert. It helps to make sure that you are building the right product for the right user. Without this feedback, it’s easy to go down the wrong path and build the wrong product. Which is hugely expensive, both in terms of time and money.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Estimable</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Remember, user stories are fundamentally about communicating expectations and facilitating estimates. They are, in many cases, the basis of </span><span>sprint planning</span><span>, which determines what work will get done, when. Good estimates are essential for knowing if your project is on track: budgetarily and from a time perspective.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Small</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Good user stories are small, just not </span><span>too small</span><span>. Depending on the project, user stories correlate with units of work from “the ideal hour of work” to “the ideal day of work” (to borrow a phrase from Mike Kuhn’s </span><span>User Stories Applied</span><span>). Developers often use a story point scale to create what constitutes a unit of work in an ideal condition. Stories much longer than a few days of work should be broken down into smaller pieces.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Testable</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Finally, good user stories should be testable. There should be clear acceptance criteria that both you - and the development team - can point to, so that you know when the story is complete. Again, writing stories in conjunction with your development team, should help you be able to know whether you’re on the right track with writing testable user stories.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The best way to make sure you can REST easy when crafting user stories, is to do them alongside the development team. When done in conversation with the development team, it becomes easier to clarify stories and begin estimating effort quickly. Their questions will help to refine your stories, and your feedback will help them to stay focused on the most important priorities. Moreover, these conversations, held frequently (because things change), can help to make sure sprints stay on track and increase the likelihood of on-time product delivery.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Great software delights users because it solves an important problem for them and makes their lives easier. Writing good user stories helps to keep you focused on building software that your users will love, but also reduces the anxiety that comes with trying to plan and estimate the time and effort involved in developing software. Avoiding these pitfalls and RESTing easy, will help you to build something awesome. &nbsp;</span></p>

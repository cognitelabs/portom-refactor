You were warned. Some of you prepared. Many didn't. Like a prepper storing canned goods in their basement, some businesses braced themselves for </span><a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/what-is-the-google-mobile-friendly-update-aka-mobilegeddon.html"><span>Google?s big mobile update</span></a><span>. They prepared their sites. They got mobile optimized.</span></p> 
     <!--more--><p dir="ltr"><span>But, like many who are certain the end won't hit in their lifetime, a lot did nothing. They waited. They avoided the truth. And then, April 21st hit. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Mobilegeddon. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>There may not have been locusts, or a tidal wave, or an asteroid, but for those that didn't prepare, there were casualties. If a company's website wasn't optimized for mobile devices, there's a chance their Google ranking (on mobile devices, anyways) sank. If you didn't prepare, you've got big problems. </span><a href="http://cognitelabs.com/contact"><span>You should reach out to us right now, so we can help you catch up</span></a><span>. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>But, at least today, we're</span><span> not</span><span> talking to you. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>We're talking to the survivors. Those that prepared, and survived, and now think they're home free. Those with their cans of beans and stacks of toilet paper, sitting pretty in their secure fallout shelters. It's time to step out and face the aftermath. Sure, you may have the supplies to survive, but what kind of life are you going to have? </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Just because you were tough enough to survive the apocalypse, doesn't mean you'll survive the fallout. Just ask over half of the original Walking Dead cast (actually you can't, because they're dead). But, ask the survivors who have made it so far and they'll probably tell you, surviving isn't always enough. The experience that's left when the dust clears makes the surviving worthwhile. So, while your website might still be ranking on Google, what kind of experience do your customers get when they visit your site on their mobile device?</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>User Behavior is Changing</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>After the apocalypse, things will be different. Normal won't be normal. The things we once took for granted will be coveted. &nbsp;A post-apocalyptic world comes with its own set of problems, but so does a post-Mobilegeddon world. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>In a mobile world, the world we are living in, we are </span><span>always</span><span> on our phones. We have relationships with them. Heck, we take them to bed with us (probably even on a first date). &nbsp;Whether we want to admit it or not, for many of us, they are the first things we look at when we wake up and the last things we see before we go to sleep. Whether this is the way it should be or not doesn't matter. It's the way it is. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Our phones have changed how we browse the web and how we accomplish tasks. In fact, we now </span><span>can accomplish </span><span>tasks from our phone.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>We couldn?t just a few years ago.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>So, t</span><a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/optimize-website-mobile-experience"><span>he way we think about the mobile experience needs to change to reflect the changes in our behavior</span></a><span>. It?s no longer enough to have a site that just looks pretty on a mobile device. </span></p> <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Now, users usually take to their phones with a question or mission. They need an answer or a product and if they are using their mobile device, they are probably in a situation where they need it at that moment.</p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>What Tasks Are Your Visitors Trying to Accomplish?</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Even simple tasks, that were once typically confined to desktops, can now be done on the run with the expectation they can be completed in a matter of minutes. Take the search for a home or property. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>If you're out and about and notice a ?For Sale? or ?For Rent? sign in front of a property that interests you, your first instinct would be to grab your phone and find details on the property management company's website. From there, you would (hopefully) be able to quickly search for the property, see the details you need, and even schedule an appointment to see the property.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Once you schedule an appointment, you would probably expect a confirmation email (which could be received on your phone or tablet) which would allow you to add the appointment to your calendar (which syncs across all your devices). </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>BUT, what happens when any of these steps don't go as planned? If the website won't load on your phone, for example, what would you do? Sit and wait for it to load? Probably not. Or, if you couldn't find the phone number quickly, would you wait until you got home and look again? Chances are by then, you would forget all about it. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>In the ideal scenario, you would be able to find all the information you need, schedule an appointment, and book it on your calendar. A really great mobile experience would use a phone?s GPS to know which property they?re in front of at that moment and load it?s specific landing page, so they can accomplish all of those tasks in a focused manner.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Many Contexts, Multiple Devices</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>In order to handle this strange, new world, those hoping to navigate it successfully need to be aware of their surroundings. They need to know what new challenges they may face, which obstacles they will have to overcome and the best ways to approach these challenges. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>This includes, for example, understanding how users use multiple devices. </span><a href="https://www.forrester.com/Customer+Experience+In+The+PostPC+Era/fulltext/-/E-RES93083"><span>According to research conducted by Forrester</span></a><span>, 75% of US online adults use 2+ devices connected to the internet, and 67% have switched devices while completing common tasks. In a post-Mobilegeddon world, your website should be able to make this experience simple, easy, and intuitive. Otherwise, you risk losing potential customers. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>It also means knowing the context in which users are using their device. For example, a </span><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/chapter-three-a-week-in-the-life-analysis-of-smartphone-users/"><span>Pew Research Center study of smartphone use</span></a><span> found that 99% of people use their device at home, 82% in transit, and 69% use them at work (</span><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/chapter-three-a-week-in-the-life-analysis-of-smartphone-users/"><span>Pew Research Center?s study of U.S. smartphone use in 2015</span></a><span>). But, what are they doing? When are they using them? Why are they using them at home when they have a computer they could use? These are the questions you are going to need to answer, because these are the experiences that matter to users. They want answers at their fingertips. They want clear, valuable content quickly. And they don't want to sacrifice simply because it's a new world. That's your problem, not theirs.</span></p> <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p> <h2 dir="ltr">So, Do You Have The Tools to Survive?</h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>A post-Mobilegeddon world may not require a crossbow, but there are some things you and your mobile site will need in order to survive. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>First, recognize that user behavior is changing. Connected users aren?t merely recreating desktop experiences. They are trying to accomplish tasks and get immediate answers to questions they have at the moment.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Second, understand what types of problems your users are trying to solve from their mobile devices. A good first step to accomplishing this is by knowing your personas well. (If you don't know your personas, figure it out.) Then, use analytics to segment out behavior by device.</span></p> <p>Finally, you need to recognize that users are using multiple devices in many different contexts. Understanding their behavior in different contexts can help you build richer experiences that can drive leads and, ultimately, sales.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Will Your Site Survive and Thrive?&nbsp;</h2> <p>

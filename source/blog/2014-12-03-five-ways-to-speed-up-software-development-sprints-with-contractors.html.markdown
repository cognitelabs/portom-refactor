This may often be the case if the core team does not know a specific technology, like AngularJS or D3js, well enough to implement some features. Still, adding hands to the mix adds risk; it requires onboarding and setting up a development environment, at a minimum. Using these five tips - and <a href="../../../../com/cognitelabs/www/blog/six-ways-to-sink-software-sprints.html" target="_blank">avoiding common mistakes</a> - can help to speed up the rate at which developers can start contributing quickly.
       <!--more--></span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>1. Start with an Isolated Project Scope</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Having a scope that is not clearly defined is one of the biggest risks to all software development sprints. This risk can be compounded when working with any new person joining an ongoing project, including third-parties and contractors. To increase the probability that the task gets done, and they can perform at the level expected, start with a narrow scope: an isolated module, a dashboard, prototyping a new feature. As expectations are met and they become more familiar with the product, it becomes easier to increase the scope without sacrificing results.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>2. Set a Clear Project Timebox</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Early on in a development relationship, there is uncertainty about how much work can be done over a given time period. Product managers responsible for shipping a product often have a vision for what the completed application will do, look like, or be. But, when onboarding a new hire or a contractor, it?s best to provide a clear deadline for when the initial, isolated scope should be completed. The specific timebox will, of course, depend on the project, and should be derived, together, by the product manager and the development team. Whatever the project?s timeframe is, though, should be clear and probably not more than 12 weeks for an initial scope. From there, individual software development sprints that vary between 2 and 3 weeks, should be derived.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>3. Give the Development Team Flexibility</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Nobody likes to be micromanaged. Great software developers will work quickly and try hard to solve problems. In many cases, they?ll come up with impressive solutions beyond the expectations of the product manager. This is most likely to happen when the development team has the flexibility to figure out the best way to implement the scope. Providing flexibility does not mean there should not be a clear scope or timebox. Rather, the opposite is true; the outcome and timebox should be clear, but the developer should have the flexibility to accomplish the goal as they see fit. Flexibility should be bookended with consistent communication, though, to ensure that the individual software development sprints stay on track.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>4. Maintain Consistent Communication</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>For many people, software development seems like a black box. A lot of work is happening in text editors, on local development machines, at varied times throughout the day. Setting an expectation for communication - and holding to it - throughout the life of a project provides visibility into the work being done. Visibility minimizes the cost of mistakes or misunderstanding and leads to products shipping faster. Maintaining consistent communication is easy, particularly with tools like Google Hangouts, Asana, and Hipchat. For contractors working in two-week timeboxes, check-ins should happen at least once a week, maybe twice, depending on the project scope. In some cases, short, daily check-ins may be necessary.</span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><span>5. Provide the Development Environment</span></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Alot of time during initial software development sprints can be wasted configuring the development environment. Different versions of software, coupled with different operating systems, can add to this time. For ongoing projects, having an environment set up in a VirtualBox or using a tool like Vagrant can help reduce the amount of time it takes the developer to configure his or her environment. This allows the development team to spend more time working on the product, which helps it get to market faster.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>For most software development projects, time is of the essence and onboarding new hires (or new contractors) takes time. Using these five tips can help speed up a team's ability to jump into a project and help get the product to market, quickly.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>

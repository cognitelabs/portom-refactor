A design brief will keep you focused on the user's goals rather than your product ambitions. Design briefs are especially useful if you?re working with a team; they help to make sure all members of the team are on the same page about what's important to the user(s).</p> 
     <!--more--><br> <h2>The Four Parts of the Design Brief</h2> <p>A good design brief will usually have four parts: </p> <pre>&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ol class="decimal left-indent"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The problem you?re trying to solve for a given user&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The steps the user takes to solve the problem &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The artifacts she uses in her process &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The obstacles she experiences along the way.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;</pre> <h2>What Problem Are You Solving? For Whom?</h2> <p>Because the most important thing for a successful application is a clear focus on solving an important problem for a given user, it is important that the design brief reflects this. Design and develoment, as with many creative endeavors, can be prone to feature creep and riddled with temptation to solve problems that don't exist. Keeping the problem statement top of mind encourages discipline and can mitigate this tendency, thus allowing you to get further, faster and cheaper.</p> <p>If possible, you want to capture this information in the user's words or terms so that the solution is represented in the terms that make sense to the user.</p> <p>You also want to make sure you have a sense for how you'll measure whether the problem has been solved - or not. For example, if the tool you're building is an invoicing tool intended to help a small business owner get paid quicker, then you?ll want to make sure you measure something like the average time an invoice is open before it gets paid.</p> <h2>What Does the User Do Now? The User's Steps</h2> <p>In order to influence what a user will do, we need to know what they do now. Articulating their steps will help you to find opportunities to make solving their problem easier.</p> <p>Returning to our invoicing example, you might ascertain that a user's process looks something like this: </p> 
     <ol class="decimal left-indent"> 
      <li>Open Calendar, Email, CRM, and Spreadsheet to prepare to invoice a client.</li> 
      <li>Go through calendar and input the total hours spent working for the client in the spreadsheet.</li> 
      <li>Next to the hours, type a description of the work performed.</li> 
      <li>Next to that, type the billing rate for those hours. </li> 
      <li>Multiply billing rate X hours in the next cell, then sum them.</li> 
      <li>Scour email to make sure there aren?t any missing hours.</li> 
      <li>Open CRM and find client?s email address.</li> 
      <li>Email spreadsheet to client.</li> 
      <li>Add a date in the calendar to follow up if the invoice hasn?t been paid by then.</li> 
     </ol> <h2>What Tools Does the User Use?</h2> <p>The next step is to identify the tools the user currently uses to solve their problem. Understanding the toolset can give insight into what other systems may need to be integrated, eliminated, or addressed, to create a good system for the user. In the example above, we?ve already identified a few: Calendar, Email, CRM, and Spreadsheet.</p> <h2>What Gets in the User's Way? The User?s Obstacles</h2> <p>What thwarts the user?s ability to accomplish their stated goals? Chances are, this is where the money is! If, for instance, the user is struggling to get paid quickly because he keeps forgetting to follow up after he?s sent an invoice until it?s too late, maybe your solution sends automatic reminders to his clients after a certain number of days. Or, maybe it sends the user an update each week of aged invoices so he can choose to follow up as he sees fit.</p> <p>Thinking through these four things will give you a robust picture of the user?s experience and offer important clues about how you might proceed to build an application that can solve the user?s problem.</p>

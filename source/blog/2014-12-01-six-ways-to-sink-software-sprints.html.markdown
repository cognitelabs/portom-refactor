      Effective, disciplined software sprints are one of the most important tools available to entrepreneurs, product managers, and technical officers looking to ship product quickly. Managing them can be hard, especially if you don't avoid these six things, which can sink sprints and increase the time it takes a product to ship.
     </div> <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p> 
     <!--more--> <h2 dir="ltr"><strong>1. The Sprint Scope Isn't Clearly Defined</strong></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>By definition, software sprints should be short, modular, clearly defined units of work. In practice, though, it's tempting to shortchange planning and clarity for production. When the scope is unclear, or worse, undefined, then the chances that the development team ships the wrong thing increases dramatically. Time is a finite resource. A clear scope ensures the development team is prioritizing the right work and spending time on the right features. This helps products ship faster. </span><span><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span></span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><strong>2. The Team is Allowed to be Distracted</strong></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Few things can sink a software sprint faster than distractions. But, they happen. Product owners change their minds mid-sprint upon seeing some of the output. Annoying bugs tempt developers who want to see them stamped out. Someone gets an idea for a cool feature that could potentially enhance the product, and wants to explore it. If these distractions are allowed to take hold, the sprint will start to drag out. Over time, this leads to listless product development and </span><span>products shipping later than expected,</span><span> if ever. For a product to ship, the team needs to remain focused.</span><span><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span></span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><strong>3. The Sprint has the Wrong Timebox</strong></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Timeboxes are short, fixed units of time in which a task is to be accomplished. Software sprints have the best chance of success when they are appropriately timeboxed. Too long and the work drags out, increasing the probability of scope creep and the chances that the team loses steam. Too short, and the amount of work that gets done isn't particularly meaningful. While the exact sprint length can vary by project, they should be consistent within a project. As a general rule of thumb, we have found sprints to be most successful when timeboxed to 2-3 weeks. </span><span><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span></span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><strong>4. The Work was Poorly Estimated</strong></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Estimating software development is an art and a science. And it's difficult for a variety of reasons: individual contributors perform at different levels, product managers have unclear expectations, problems turn out to be harder to solve than expected, testing wasn't accounted for and so on. Despite the difficulty involved in estimation, products still need to ship. To mitigate estimation risk, teams should be in the discipline of tracking some measure of difficulty per task per sprint. If estimates are being tracked, then estimation risk should decrease over the duration of a project. If they are not being tracked, then the probability of shipping product quickly decreases.</span><span><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span></span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><strong>5. Poor Communication</strong></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>Software development is a dynamic process. Roadblocks will happen: dependent tasks will not have been satisfactorily completed, developers won't understand a specification, a task will be harder than anticipated. Each of these things can increase the likelihood of a sprint failing, and a </span><span>product taking longer to ship than expected.</span><span> Poor communication further exacerbates these problems. To reduce communication risk, it's helpful to have short, frequent, consistent check-ins to provide updates, discuss roadblocks, and make sure work is being properly prioritized. Depending on the size and scope of the project, these check-ins can range from daily to weekly. Tools such as Asana, Trello, Hipchat, and Slack also help to increase the pace of communication. </span><span><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span></span></p> <h2 dir="ltr"><strong>6. The Team Doesn't Have the Right Skills</strong></h2> <p dir="ltr"><span>At a fundamental level, software development is a human exercise, and humans have different capabilities. Even if the team is full of talented developers, if the project calls for a skill or technology that the development team is less adept at, then the project can take longer than expected, leading to products shipping later than desired. While it can be tempting to expect your star developers to 'figure it out,' there's an associated opportunity cost: if a talented developer is spending time learning a new skill during a sprint, then he or she is also not performing the task they're exceptional at. It's a double whammy. In these cases, finding a reliable team to address the skill gap can help to increase the probability of shipping product quickly.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Software product development is difficult and risky. Avoiding these six mistakes when executing software sprints can increase the probability that the sprint succeeds and the product can ship on time.</span></p>
